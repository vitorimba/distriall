# Create Decision Matrix Task

ACTIVATION-NOTICE: This task file contains complete instructions for workflow selection.

## Metadata

```yaml
task:
  name: Create Decision Matrix
  id: create-decision-matrix
  version: "1.0"

    - eugene-schwartz
    - dan-kennedy
    - todd-brown
  estimated_output: Workflow recommendation with initial configuration
  quality_standard: All 5 questions answered + clear workflow recommendation
```

---

## Purpose

Execute the 5-Question Decision Matrix to determine the optimal workflow for any copywriting project. This is the **MANDATORY FIRST STEP** before starting any workflow in the Copy expansion pack.

---

## When to Use

- **ALWAYS FIRST** - Before selecting any workflow (wf-1 through wf-7)
- When starting a new copy project
- When pivoting an existing project
- When unclear which workflow fits best
- When optimizing existing funnel

---

## The 5-Question Decision Matrix

```
DECISION MATRIX FOR WORKFLOW SELECTION

Before starting ANY workflow, answer these 5 questions:

Q1 → AWARENESS LEVEL → Copy approach
Q2 → MARKET SOPHISTICATION → Mechanism requirements
Q3 → PRICE POINT → Proof & objection handling
Q4 → TRAFFIC TEMPERATURE → Entry point strategy
Q5 → PRIMARY OUTPUT → Workflow selection
```

---

## Inputs

```yaml
required:
  - product_name: What you're selling
  - target_market: Who you're selling to
  - price_point: Approximate price of offer
  - traffic_source: Where prospects come from

optional:
  - competitor_landscape: Who else serves this market
  - existing_assets: What copy/content already exists
  - timeline: When this needs to be ready
  - team_resources: Who will execute
```

## Workflow

### Step 1: Answer Q1 - Awareness Level

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
Q1: AWARENESS LEVEL (Schwartz Framework)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Where is your prospect on the awareness spectrum?

□ LEVEL 1 - UNAWARE
  "Don't know they have a problem"
  → Need story-based, educational approach
  → Longest copy, most nurturing required
  → Workflows: WF-4 (Organic), WF-5 (Email nurture)

□ LEVEL 2 - PROBLEM-AWARE
  "Know the problem, don't know solutions exist"
  → Lead with problem agitation
  → Medium-long copy, solution introduction
  → Workflows: WF-4 (Organic), WF-1 (Full Launch)

□ LEVEL 3 - SOLUTION-AWARE
  "Know solutions exist, don't know YOUR product"
  → Lead with unique mechanism
  → Differentiation critical
  → Workflows: WF-1 (Full Launch), WF-2 (Paid Traffic)

□ LEVEL 4 - PRODUCT-AWARE
  "Know your product, not convinced yet"
  → Lead with proof and objection removal
  → Medium copy, heavy proof
  → Workflows: WF-6 (Optimization), WF-2 (Paid Traffic)

□ LEVEL 5 - MOST AWARE
  "Ready to buy, just need the offer"
  → Lead with offer and urgency
  → Short copy, direct CTA
  → Workflows: WF-6 (Optimization), WF-1 (Launch re-open)

YOUR ANSWER: Level ___

DIAGNOSTIC HELP:
- Where does your traffic come from?
  • Cold ads → Level 1-2
  • Search → Level 2-3
  • Retargeting → Level 4
  • Email list → Level 4-5
  • Past customers → Level 5
```

### Step 2: Answer Q2 - Market Sophistication

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
Q2: MARKET SOPHISTICATION (Schwartz Scale)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

How evolved is your market in terms of claims and mechanisms?

□ STAGE 1 - VIRGIN MARKET
  "No one has made this promise before"
  → Simple, direct claims work
  → No mechanism needed
  → First mover advantage

□ STAGE 2 - CLAIMS ENLARGEMENT
  "Claims have been made, must top them"
  → Bigger, faster, easier promises
  → Enlargement competition
  → Still no mechanism required

□ STAGE 3 - MECHANISM REQUIRED
  "Market tired of claims, needs HOW"
  → Unique mechanism mandatory
  → Science/process explanation
  → Todd Brown E5 Method critical

□ STAGE 4 - TIRED OF MECHANISMS
  "Everyone has a 'system' now"
  → Identification over mechanism
  → "For [specific avatar] who..."
  → Deep empathy required

□ STAGE 5 - COMPLETELY SKEPTICAL
  "Heard it all, believe none"
  → Identity/emotion based
  → Community/belonging focus
  → Authenticity paramount

YOUR ANSWER: Stage ___

DIAGNOSTIC HELP:
- Count competitors with "proprietary methods":
  • 0-2 competitors → Stage 1-2
  • 3-10 competitors → Stage 3
  • 10+ competitors → Stage 4-5
- Do prospects roll their eyes at new claims? → Stage 4-5
```

### Step 3: Answer Q3 - Price Point

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
Q3: PRICE POINT
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

What is the price of your primary offer?

□ LOW TICKET: Under $100
  → Impulse purchase possible
  → Less proof required
  → Shorter decision cycle
  → Workflows: WF-2 (Paid Traffic), WF-4 (Organic)

□ MID TICKET: $100 - $1,000
  → Need clear value proposition
  → Moderate proof required
  → Days to decide
  → Workflows: WF-1 (Full Launch), WF-2 (Paid Traffic)

□ HIGH TICKET: $1,000 - $5,000
  → Significant proof required
  → Objection handling critical
  → Weeks to decide
  → Workflows: WF-1 (Full Launch), WF-3 (High-Ticket)

□ PREMIUM: $5,000+
  → Application process recommended
  → Extensive proof stack
  → Sales calls typically required
  → Workflows: WF-3 (High-Ticket) mandatory

YOUR ANSWER: ___________

PRICE POINT → PROOF REQUIREMENTS:
- Low: Testimonials, results screenshots
- Mid: Case studies, specific numbers
- High: Video testimonials, detailed case studies
- Premium: References, live Q&A, guarantees
```

### Step 4: Answer Q4 - Traffic Temperature

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
Q4: TRAFFIC TEMPERATURE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

How warm is your traffic source?

□ COLD TRAFFIC
  "Never heard of you"
  → Long-form content required
  → Trust building first
  → Multi-touch sequence
  → Workflows: WF-2 (with cold ads focus), WF-4 (Organic)

□ WARM TRAFFIC
  "Heard of you, engaged with content"
  → Medium-form effective
  → Differentiation focus
  → Faster conversion possible
  → Workflows: WF-1 (Full Launch), WF-5 (Email)

□ HOT TRAFFIC
  "Engaged, ready to learn more"
  → Direct offers can work
  → Proof stacking effective
  → Urgency moves them
  → Workflows: WF-1 (Launch), WF-6 (Optimization)

YOUR ANSWER: ___________

TRAFFIC SOURCE → TEMPERATURE MAPPING:
- Facebook/Instagram cold ads → COLD
- Google search ads → WARM
- YouTube subscribers → WARM
- Email list (engaged) → HOT
- Past customers → HOT
- Retargeting → WARM to HOT
```

### Step 5: Answer Q5 - Primary Output Needed

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
Q5: PRIMARY OUTPUT
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

What is the main deliverable you need?

□ VSL (Video Sales Letter)
  → Jon Benson methodology
  → Emotional progression
  → Workflows: WF-1, WF-3

□ SALES LETTER (Long-form written)
  → Gary Halbert methodology
  → Story-driven
  → Workflows: WF-1, WF-3, WF-7

□ EMAIL SEQUENCE
  → Andre Chaperon or Ben Settle
  → SOS or Daily methodology
  → Workflows: WF-5

□ AD CREATIVE
  → Multi-format (video, image, text)
  → Platform specific
  → Workflows: WF-2

□ WEBINAR
  → Education + pitch
  → Benson + Makepeace blend
  → Workflows: WF-3

□ DIRECT MAIL
  → Rutz, Lampropoulos, Deutsch
  → Physical package
  → Workflows: WF-7

□ LANDING PAGE
  → Lead capture or sales
  → Conversion focused
  → Workflows: WF-1, WF-2

□ CONTENT (Organic)
  → Social posts, newsletters
  → Brand building
  → Workflows: WF-4

□ FUNNEL OPTIMIZATION
  → Improve existing assets
  → A/B testing
  → Workflows: WF-6

  # Content Path
  if_content_output:
    condition: "Primary Output = Content (Organic)"
    recommendation: "WF-4 Organic Content"
    reason: "Brand building and cold traffic warming"

  # Paid Traffic Path
  if_ad_output_or_cold:
    condition: "Primary Output = Ad Creative OR Traffic = Cold"
    recommendation: "WF-2 Paid Traffic"
    reason: "Optimized for paid acquisition"

  # Default Launch Path
  default:
    condition: "All other cases"
    recommendation: "WF-1 Full Launch"

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

```
MISTAKE 1: Skipping the Decision Matrix
- Symptom: Choosing workflow based on preference, not data
- Fix: Always answer all 5 questions before selecting

MISTAKE 2: Misdiagnosing Awareness Level
- Symptom: Copy mismatches where traffic is
- Fix: Cross-reference traffic source with awareness

MISTAKE 3: Ignoring Market Sophistication
- Symptom: Simple claims in sophisticated market
- Fix: Run diagnose-market-sophistication.md

MISTAKE 4: Price-Workflow Mismatch
- Symptom: Using WF-2 for $5k+ offers
- Fix: Premium ALWAYS needs WF-3

MISTAKE 5: Starting Without Foundation
- Symptom: Jumping to execution without strategy
- Fix: Tier 0 agents (Hopkins, Schwartz, Collier) first
```

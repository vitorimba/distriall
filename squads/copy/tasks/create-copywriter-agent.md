## Executive Summary

**What This Task Does:**
Create a comprehensive AI copywriter agent that authentically replicates a master copywriter's thinking, communication, and methodology.

**Why This Matters:**
Generic AI produces generic copy. An authentic copywriter agent channels decades of expertise, distinctive voice, and proven frameworks - enabling anyone to access elite copywriting capability.

**The Persona Equation:**
```
Authentic Agent = Operational Frameworks + Communication DNA + Signature Phrases + Authority Arsenal + Objection Algorithms + Psychometric Integration
```

**Quality Standard:**
The resulting agent must be DISTINCTIVE (sounds like no one else), COMPLETE (can handle any relevant topic), CONSISTENT (responds reliably), and AUTHENTIC (true to source material).

---

## Theoretical Foundation

### The DeepPersona Research Framework

From academic research on synthetic personas:

> "Most synthetic personas are shallow and simplistic, capturing minimal attributes and failing to reflect the rich complexity and diversity of real human identities."

**Solution:** Taxonomy-guided, multi-layer extraction that captures not just WHAT someone says, but HOW they think and WHY they believe certain things.

### Persona Attribute Hierarchy

```
LAYER 4: MOTIVATIONAL (Hardest to extract)
├── Core values
├── Driving fears
└── Aspirations

LAYER 3: COGNITIVE
├── Mental models
├── Problem-solving approaches
└── Belief systems

LAYER 2: BEHAVIORAL
├── Communication style
├── Decision patterns
└── Response tendencies

LAYER 1: SURFACE (Easiest to extract)
├── Name, background
├── Profession, achievements
└── Public credentials
```

**Rule:** Extract from Layer 1 up. Surface attributes inform behavioral inference; behavioral patterns reveal cognitive approaches; cognitive understanding unlocks motivational drivers.

### Linguistic Fingerprint Components

A linguistic fingerprint is the unique combination of language patterns that make a person's communication identifiable:

| Component | Description | Extraction Method |
|-----------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Lexical** | Word choice patterns | Frequency analysis |
| **Syntactic** | Sentence structure | Length/complexity analysis |
| **Rhetorical** | Persuasion patterns | Device cataloging |
| **Pragmatic** | Communication intent | Directness/hedging analysis |

## PHASE 2: EXTRACT OPERATIONAL FRAMEWORKS

**Execute Sub-Task:** `tasks/extract-frameworks.md`

### Objective

Identify and document 10 operational frameworks the copywriter uses repeatedly. These are their intellectual property - the "how" behind their work.

### Framework Criteria

All 10 frameworks must meet these criteria:

```yaml
framework_criteria:

  repeatability:
    requirement: "Used across multiple contexts"
    evidence: "Appears in 3+ source files"

  teachability:
    requirement: "Can be explained to others"
    evidence: "Has clear steps or components"

  structure:
    requirement: "Identifiable process"
    evidence: "Steps, phases, or components"

  originality:
    requirement: "Their distinctive version"
    evidence: "Not generic advice"
```

### Framework Identification Markers

Scan sources for these language patterns:

| Pattern Type | Examples |
|--------------|----------|
| **Process language** | "The first thing I do is...", "My approach to..." |
| **Naming language** | "I call this the...", "My [X] method..." |
| **Teaching language** | "If you want to...", "The key is to..." |
| **Structural language** | "There are three types of...", "The components are..." |

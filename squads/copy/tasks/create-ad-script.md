## Phase 7: Ad Assembly Matrix

### 7.1 Combinatorial Math

```yaml
formula: "50 hooks × 3-5 meats × 1-3 CTAs = 150-750 ad combinations"

example_calculation:
  hooks: 50
  meats: 4
  ctas: 3
  total_combinations: "50 × 4 × 3 = 600 unique ads"

reality_check: |
  You don't test all 600 at once.
  Start with top 10-20 combinations based on hypothesis.
  Let data guide expansion.
```

### 7.2 Assembly Strategy

```yaml
testing_priority:
  wave_1:
    focus: "Hooks (80% of impact)"
    test: "5-10 hook variations with 1 meat and 1 CTA"
    budget: "20% of test budget"

  wave_2:
    focus: "Meats with winning hooks"
    test: "Top 3 hooks × 3-4 meat formats"
    budget: "40% of test budget"

  wave_3:
    focus: "CTAs with winning combinations"
    test: "Top 2-3 hook+meat combos × 2-3 CTAs"
    budget: "40% of test budget"

  scale:
    focus: "Scale proven winners"
    action: "Increase budget on winners, create variations"
```

### 7.3 Assembly Matrix Template

```yaml
matrix_example:
  |
  | Hook Type  | Demo | Testimonial | Education | Story | CTA Options |
  |------------|------|-------------|-----------|-------|-------------|
  | Curiosity  | ✓    | -           | ✓         | ✓     | All 3       |
  | Pain       | -    | ✓           | ✓         | -     | 1, 3        |
  | Promise    | ✓    | -           | ✓         | ✓     | All 3       |
  | Proof      | -    | ✓           | -         | -     | 1, 2        |
  | Offer      | ✓    | -           | -         | -     | 2           |

top_10_combinations_to_test:
  1: "[Curiosity Hook #1] + [Demo] + [Direct CTA]"
  2: "[Pain Hook #1] + [Testimonial] + [Benefit CTA]"
  3: "[Promise Hook #1] + [Education] + [Direct CTA]"
  4: "[Curiosity Hook #2] + [Story] + [Curiosity CTA]"
  5: "[Pain Hook #2] + [Education] + [Direct CTA]"
  # ... continue for 10

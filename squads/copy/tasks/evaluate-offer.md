# Evaluate Offer Task

**Task ID:** evaluate-offer
**Version:** 2.0.0
**Category:** Offer Optimization / Audit
**Minimum Output:** Complete scorecard with prioritized fixes
**Primary Methodology:** Hormozi Value Equation + Kennedy Direct Response Principles
**Research Source:** docs/research/offer-evaluation-methodology-research.md

---

## Purpose

Perform a comprehensive audit of any offer using the Value Equation framework and Grand Slam Offer criteria. Generate a numerical score (0-100) and prioritized improvement recommendations.

**The Problem:** Most offers fail not because of bad products, but because of poor offer construction. Symptoms include:
- "Too expensive" objections despite competitive pricing
- "Need to think about it" killing momentum
- Prospects comparing you to cheaper alternatives
- Low conversion rates despite good traffic
- High refund rates after purchase

**The Solution:** A systematic evaluation using proven frameworks that diagnoses EXACTLY what's weak and provides a prioritized fix list.

---

## When to Use

### Primary Triggers
- Conversion rate below 5% (traffic to purchase)
- "Need to think about it" exceeds 50% of prospects
- Price objections dominate sales conversations
- Preparing to invest in paid traffic
- Planning to raise prices
- Launching a new product/service
- Conversion has dropped without explanation

### Secondary Triggers
- Annual offer review
- Competitive pressure increasing
- Refund rate above 5%
- Customer acquisition cost rising
- Market conditions changing

---

## Inputs Required

```yaml
required:
  offer_name: "Nome do produto/serviço"

## Theoretical Foundation

### The Value Equation (Alex Hormozi)

The foundational framework for understanding why people buy:

```
                 Dream Outcome × Perceived Likelihood
Value = ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
              Time Delay × Effort & Sacrifice
```

**Key Insight:** You can increase value by:
1. Making the outcome more desirable (numerator)
2. Making success more likely (numerator)
3. Decreasing time to result (denominator)
4. Decreasing effort required (denominator)

Most offers only try to improve the numerator. **Grand Slam Offers aggressively minimize the denominator.**

### Grand Slam Offer Definition

> "An offer so good that people feel stupid saying no."
> — Alex Hormozi

Five required components:
1. **Starving Crowd** - Market that desperately wants what you sell
2. **Irresistible Offer** - Value stack perceived at 10x+ the price
3. **Unique Mechanism** - Proprietary system that explains why it works
4. **Risk Reversal** - Guarantee that removes all customer risk
5. **Urgency/Scarcity** - Real reason to act now

### Dan Kennedy's Offer Rules

Every strong offer must have:
1. A specific, clear offer (not just product info)
2. A reason to respond NOW
3. Clear instructions on how to respond
4. Tracking and measurement capability
5. Strong sales copy

### Phase 2: Value Equation Scoring

#### Step 2.1: Score Dream Outcome (0-10)

**DREAM OUTCOME** = The ultimate result your customer desires

**Scoring Criteria:**

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 1-2 | Vague outcome, hard to visualize |
| 3-4 | Somewhat defined but not compelling |
| 5-6 | Clear outcome, moderate desirability |
| 7-8 | Specific, measurable, highly desirable |
| 9-10 | Crystal clear, life-changing, status-elevating |

**Evaluation Questions:**

```yaml
dream_outcome_audit:
  specificity:
    question: "Can the customer visualize the EXACT result?"
    weak_example: "Improve your marketing"
    strong_example: "Add $50K/month in recurring revenue"

  measurability:
    question: "Can progress be measured objectively?"
    weak_example: "Feel better about your business"
    strong_example: "Reduce customer churn from 8% to 2%"

  desirability:
    question: "Is this a MUST-HAVE or nice-to-have?"
    weak_example: "Learn new skills"
    strong_example: "Finally quit your 9-5 and go full-time"

  status_change:
    question: "Does achieving this change how they're seen?"
    weak_example: "Have a better website"
    strong_example: "Become the go-to expert in your market"

  emotional_pull:
    question: "Does it connect to deep desires/fears?"
    weak_example: "Increase efficiency"
    strong_example: "Never worry about making payroll again"
```

**Red Flags (Score 1-4):**
- Generic benefit claims
- No specific numbers or timeframes
- Outcome sounds like everyone else
- Hard to explain to a friend

**Green Flags (Score 7-10):**
- Specific, measurable result
- Clear timeframe
- Identity/status transformation
- Emotional resonance
- Unique angle or approach

**DREAM OUTCOME SCORE: ___/10**

---

#### Step 2.4: Score Effort & Sacrifice (0-10, then INVERT)

**EFFORT & SACRIFICE** = What the customer must do/give up to get results

**Note:** Score the EFFORT, then invert (10 - score) for final calculation because LOWER effort = HIGHER value.

**Scoring Criteria (Raw Effort Score):**

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 1-2 | Almost nothing required, done for you |
| 3-4 | Minimal effort, clear steps |
| 5-6 | Moderate effort, guided process |

### Phase 7: Diagnosis & Recommendations

#### Step 7.1: Score Interpretation

```yaml
diagnosis_matrix:
  0-30:
    rating: "BROKEN"
    emoji: "🔴"
    meaning: "Offer needs complete rebuild"
    action: "Don't spend on traffic until fixed"
    priority: "Redesign from scratch using Grand Slam framework"

  31-50:
    rating: "WEAK"
    emoji: "🟠"
    meaning: "Major structural problems"
    action: "Significant restructuring required"
    priority: "Fix value equation fundamentals first"

  51-70:
    rating: "DECENT"
    emoji: "🟡"
    meaning: "Working but underperforming"
    action: "Optimization will yield strong returns"
    priority: "Strengthen weakest components"

  71-85:
    rating: "GOOD"
    emoji: "🟢"
    meaning: "Solid offer with fine-tuning opportunities"
    action: "A/B test enhancements"
    priority: "Test pricing, guarantees, bonuses"

  86-100:
    rating: "GRAND SLAM"
    emoji: "💎"
    meaning: "Exceptional offer"
    action: "Scale traffic, protect positioning"
    priority: "Document what works, scale carefully"
```

#### Step 7.2: Generate Prioritized Fix List

**Priority Calculation:** Impact × Ease

```yaml
fix_priority_matrix:
  high_impact_easy:
    priority: 1
    examples:
      - "Add specific numbers to outcome claims"
      - "Name your methodology"
      - "Extend guarantee period"
      - "Add real deadline"
      - "Itemize value stack with dollars"

  high_impact_hard:
    priority: 2
    examples:
      - "Rebuild value stack completely"
      - "Add case studies/testimonials"
      - "Change pricing model"
      - "Reposition to different market"

  low_impact_easy:
    priority: 3
    examples:
      - "Minor copy tweaks"
      - "Add small bonus"
      - "Design improvements"

  low_impact_hard:
    priority: 4
    examples:
      - "Complete rebrand"
      - "New technology platform"
      - "Major operational changes"
```

  executive_summary:
    - "Offer name and current state"
    - "Overall score and diagnosis"
    - "Top 3 critical issues"
    - "Recommended next steps"

  detailed_scorecard:
    - "Section A: Value Equation breakdown"
    - "Section B: Grand Slam components breakdown"
    - "Section C: Enhancement stack breakdown"
    - "Section D: Red flags identified"
    - "Final score calculation"

  diagnosis:
    - "Score interpretation"
    - "What's working well"
    - "What's holding the offer back"
    - "Market and competitive context"

  prioritized_fixes:
    - "Fix #1: [Highest priority]"
    - "Fix #2: [Second priority]"
    - "Fix #3: [Third priority]"
    - "Quick wins list (implement today)"

  implementation_roadmap:
    - "Week 1 actions"
    - "Week 2-4 actions"
    - "Month 2+ actions"
    - "Testing recommendations"

## Common Problems & Solutions Quick Reference

| Symptom | Likely Weak Area | Quick Fix |
|---------|-----------------|-----------|
| "Too expensive" | Value Stack | Add itemized value with dollar amounts |
| "Need to think" | Perceived Likelihood | Add case studies, strengthen guarantee |
| "What's included?" | Value Communication | Create explicit value stack |
| "Does it work for me?" | Proof | Add testimonials from similar customers |
| "Takes too long" | Time Delay | Add 24-48 hour quick win |
| "Too complicated" | Effort Required | Add done-for-you elements |
| "Sounds like X competitor" | Unique Mechanism | Name and explain your proprietary method |
| "What if it doesn't work?" | Guarantee | Create bold, specific risk reversal |
| "I'll think about it" | Urgency | Add real deadline with consequence |

# Create Video Hook Task - Master Protocol

## Meta

```yaml
task_id: create-video-hook
version: 2.0.0
category: copy_creation
complexity: advanced
estimated_time: 30-60 min
dependencies:
  - diagnose-awareness-level.md
related_agents:
  - jon-benson.md
  - gary-halbert.md
  - todd-brown.md
research_source: docs/research/video-hook-methodology-research.md
```

---

## Purpose

Create video hooks that capture attention in the first 1-5 seconds and drive viewer retention across all video platforms—TikTok, Instagram Reels, YouTube Shorts, YouTube Ads, and VSLs (Video Sales Letters).

**Core Philosophy:** The 3-second threshold is the primary algorithmic checkpoint. Videos with 65%+ retention at 3 seconds receive 4-7x more impressions. Your hook must combine visual interruption, verbal engagement, and psychological triggers simultaneously.

---

## When to Use

### Ideal Use Cases

| Situation | Platform | Hook Length |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| Creating VSL for sales page | Landing Page | 15-60 seconds |
| Running YouTube pre-roll ads | YouTube Ads | 5 seconds (anti-skip) |
| Organic YouTube content | YouTube Shorts | 3-5 seconds |
| Instagram content | Reels | 3 seconds |
| TikTok content | TikTok | 1-3 seconds |
| Facebook video ads | Facebook/Meta | 3 seconds |
| Opening webinars or lives | Webinar | 30-60 seconds |

### Platform Decision Matrix

| If Your Goal Is... | Use This Platform | Hook Priority |
|-------------------|-------------------|---------------|
| Viral reach + brand awareness | TikTok | Native feel, trend integration |
| High-quality engaged audience | Instagram Reels | Aesthetic + value |
| Evergreen discovery + subscribers | YouTube Shorts | Clear topic + value promise |
| Direct response conversions | YouTube Ads | Anti-skip + qualification |
| Sales conversions | VSL | Big idea + curiosity loop |

## The 3-Second Threshold Science

### Why 3 Seconds Matters

The 3-second mark serves as the primary algorithmic checkpoint:

```
RETENTION CASCADE:

0-3 seconds → Algorithm evaluates → Push or bury decision
3-10 seconds → 65% continue → Content gets distribution
10-30 seconds → 45% continue → Algorithm boost
Full completion → Maximum distribution + recommendations
```

**Key Statistics:**
- **65%+ retention at 3 seconds** → 4-7x more impressions
- **Below 65% retention** → Content gets algorithmically buried
- **65% who watch first 3 seconds** → Continue for 10+ seconds
- **45% of those retained** → Watch for 30+ seconds

### The Two-Second Reality

While 3 seconds is measured, the decision happens earlier:

```
DECISION TIMELINE:

0-0.5s: Initial visual processing
0.5-1s: Novelty assessment ("What's this?")
1-2s:   Relevance judgment ("Is this for me?")
2-3s:   Engagement decision ("Should I watch?")
3s+:    Algorithm measurement ("Push or bury?")

IMPLICATION: Your stopping element must occur within first 2 seconds
```

---

## Psychological Triggers Framework

### Seven Core Triggers

Every effective hook leverages one or more psychological triggers:

| # | Trigger | Brain Question | Example |
|---|---------|----------------|---------|
| 1 | **Pattern Interrupt** | "What was that?" | Unexpected visual/sound |
| 2 | **Curiosity Gap** | "I need to know!" | Open loop, incomplete info |
| 3 | **Shock/Arousal** | "Did they really say that?" | Bold claim, surprising stat |
| 4 | **Visual Intrigue** | "What am I looking at?" | Motion, contrast, color |
| 5 | **Relatability** | "That's me!" | POV, common experience |
| 6 | **Value-First** | "This could help me!" | Clear benefit promise |
| 7 | **Social Proof/FOMO** | "Everyone's doing this!" | Numbers, urgency |

### Trigger Selection by Platform

| Platform | Primary Triggers | Secondary Triggers |
|----------|-----------------|-------------------|
| TikTok | Relatability, Pattern Interrupt | Curiosity, Value |
| Reels | Visual Intrigue, Value-First | Social Proof, Shock |
| Shorts | Curiosity Gap, Value-First | Shock, Pattern Interrupt |
| YouTube Ads | Pattern Interrupt, Shock | FOMO, Value |
| VSL | Curiosity Gap, Shock | Value, Pattern Interrupt |

### The H.O.O.K. Framework

**H - Halt the Scroll**
- Visual or audio pattern interrupt
- Something unexpected/different in first 0.5 seconds

**O - Offer Relevance**
- "This is for YOU specifically"
- Avatar qualification in seconds 1-2

**O - Open a Loop**
- Create information gap
- Tease without revealing

**K - Keep Them Watching**
- Promise value/resolution
- Give timeline expectation

## Pattern Interrupt Techniques

### Visual Pattern Interrupts

| Technique | Description | When to Use |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| **Extreme Close-Up** | Face fills 80%+ of frame | Personal content, emotional hooks |
| **Unexpected Movement** | Sudden motion in static scene | Attention capture |
| **Color Contrast** | Bright/unusual color palette | Standing out in feed |
| **Text Overlay Shock** | Large, bold text with number/claim | Statistical hooks |
| **Unusual Angle** | Camera position defies expectation | Pattern breaking |
| **Object Intrusion** | Unexpected item enters frame | Product demos |
| **Split Second Flash** | Brief visual that demands rewatch | Proof/evidence hooks |

### Audio Pattern Interrupts

| Technique | Description | When to Use |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| **Sudden Silence** | Music/sound cuts abruptly | Creating tension |
| **Unexpected Sound** | Sound that doesn't match visual | Pattern breaking |
| **Volume Spike** | Sudden loud moment | Command attention |
| **Whisper Contrast** | Unusually quiet delivery | Sharing secrets |
| **Sound Effect Emphasis** | Effect punctuates statement | Emphasizing claims |

### Verbal Pattern Interrupts

| Technique | Example | Effect |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| **Direct Command** | "Stop scrolling." | Triggers compliance |
| **Contrarian Statement** | "Everything you know is wrong." | Creates cognitive dissonance |
| **Incomplete Thought** | "The one thing that changed..." | Zeigarnik effect |
| **Question Direct** | "Can I ask you something?" | Personal address |
| **Confession** | "I made a huge mistake." | Vulnerability creates connection |

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Pre-Hook Strategy

#### Step 1.1: Platform Analysis

```yaml
PLATFORM REQUIREMENTS:

tiktok:
  hook_window: 1-2 seconds
  text_overlay: Essential (sound-off viewers)
  native_feel: Critical (ad-looking content punished)
  trend_integration: Helpful (algorithm boost)
  face_presence: Recommended (higher engagement)
  format: Vertical 9:16

instagram_reels:
  hook_window: 3 seconds
  text_overlay: Important
  visual_quality: Higher standard required
  brand_polish: Accepted (platform tolerates branded)
  aesthetic: Important (low-quality gets scrolled)
  format: Vertical 9:16

youtube_shorts:
  hook_window: 3 seconds
  clear_subject: Essential (instant topic clarity)
  quality: Important (platform expectations)
  value_promise: Critical (YouTube audience expects learning)
  format: Vertical 9:16

youtube_ads:
  hook_window: 5 seconds (beat skip button)
  anti_skip_design: Critical
  immediate_value: Essential (justify interruption)
  qualification: Important (right viewers fast)
  format: Horizontal 16:9 or Vertical

vsl:
  hook_window: 15-60 seconds
  qualification: Essential
  big_idea_tease: Critical
  credibility_hint: Important
  curiosity_loop: Necessary
  format: Horizontal 16:9
```

#### Step 1.2: Awareness Level Calibration

Adapt hook approach based on audience awareness:

| Awareness Level | Hook Focus | Example Approach |
|----------------|------------|------------------|
| **Unaware** | Problem identification | "Do you ever feel [symptom]?" |
| **Problem Aware** | Solution teasing | "Why [common solutions] fail..." |
| **Solution Aware** | Mechanism differentiation | "Forget [common]. Try [unique]." |
| **Product Aware** | Proof and urgency | "Here's why [number] chose this" |
| **Most Aware** | Offer and action | "Ready? Here's how to start today." |

#### Step 1.3: Big Idea Development (For VSL/Ads)

Before writing the hook, define the Big Idea:

```yaml
BIG_IDEA_FORMULA:

"The [Unique Mechanism Name] that [Specific Result]
without [Pain Avoided]"

CRITERIA:
- Different from everything audience has seen
- Specific (not generic)
- Credible (with proof or logic)
- Desirable (audience wants this)
- Explainable in one sentence

EXAMPLES:
- "The Metabolic Reset Protocol that burns fat while you sleep—without dieting"
- "The 3-Step Funnel Framework that generated [RESULTADO_ESCALADO_EXEMPLO]—without paid ads"
- "The Conversation Closing Method that closes 80%—without feeling salesy"
```

### Phase 2: Hook Formula Selection

Example: "90 days. [RESULTADO_TOTAL_EXEMPLO]. Zero paid ads. That's exactly what I'm showing you how to replicate."
```

### Phase 3: Hook Creation

#### Step 3.1: Write Multiple Variations

For each video, create at least 5 hook variations:

```yaml
VARIATION STRATEGY:

variation_1:
  formula: Pattern Interrupt
  trigger: Shock/Arousal

variation_2:
  formula: Bold Claim
  trigger: Social Proof

variation_3:
  formula: Question
  trigger: Curiosity Gap

variation_4:
  formula: Story Opening
  trigger: Relatability

variation_5:
  formula: Contrarian
  trigger: Pattern Interrupt
```

#### Step 3.2: Apply Visual Hook Design

For each hook, specify visual elements:

```yaml
VISUAL HOOK COMPONENTS:

text_overlay:
  content: "[3-5 word hook summary]"
  position: center-top
  font: Bold sans-serif
  color: High contrast (white on dark, yellow highlight)
  animation: Simple appear/pop

first_frame:
  subject: Face at 40% of frame OR product demonstration
  background: Contextual, uncluttered
  eye_path: Face → Text → Context

movement:
  type: [zoom_in | zoom_out | pan | snap_cut | static]
  timing: Movement in first 0.5 seconds
  purpose: Pattern interrupt

color_strategy:
  primary: [Based on platform and emotion]
  accent: High contrast for key elements
  consistency: Match brand guidelines if applicable
```

#### Step 3.3: Apply Audio Hook Design

```yaml
AUDIO HOOK COMPONENTS:

first_words:
  type: [command | question | statement | exclamation]
  examples:
    command: "Stop.", "Wait.", "Listen."
    question: "Can I?", "Why?", "What if?"
    statement: "This changed...", "The truth is..."
    exclamation: "Finally!", "Yes!", "Wow!"

delivery:
  energy_level: [high | medium | whisper]
  pace: Varies by platform (TikTok fastest, VSL slowest)
  emphasis: Stress on key words

sound_design:
  music: [trending | branded | none]
  effects: Impact sounds at key moments
  volume: Consider mute-ready design

mute_ready_check:
  - [ ] Visual is self-explanatory
  - [ ] Text overlay carries message
  - [ ] Emotion readable from expression
  - [ ] Value proposition visible
```

#### Step 3.4: VSL Extended Hook Structure

For VSLs, follow extended timeline:

```yaml
VSL_HOOK_TIMELINE:

0-5s: PATTERN INTERRUPT
  - Visual or audio stop
  - Bold opening statement/question

5-15s: QUALIFICATION
  - "If you're [avatar]..."
  - "This is specifically for..."
  - Self-select right viewers

15-30s: BIG IDEA TEASE
  - Introduce mechanism name
  - Hint at unique approach
  - Create curiosity gap

30-45s: CREDIBILITY ESTABLISHMENT
  - Result proof hint
  - Authority positioning
  - "Why listen to me?"

45-60s: WATCH PROMISE
  - What they'll learn
  - Why it matters
  - Time expectation
```

  - Hook length (3s vs. 5s vs. 8s)

low_priority:
  - Background music
  - Color scheme
  - Specific word choices
```

#### Step 5.2: Metrics to Track

  full_completion: "% who watch entire video"

SECONDARY_METRICS:
  ctr: "Click-through rate on CTA"
  engagement: "Likes, comments, shares"
  watch_time: "Total accumulated view time"
  rewatch_rate: "% who rewatch portions"
```

#### Step 5.3: Test Protocol

```yaml
TESTING_PROTOCOL:

phase_1_hook_type_test:
  variants: 5 (different hook formulas)
  same_content: Yes
  duration: 48 hours minimum
  winner_criteria: Highest 3-second retention

phase_2_hook_optimization:
  variants: 3 (winning type variations)
  test_elements: Copy, visual, energy
  duration: 48 hours
  winner_criteria: Highest full completion

phase_3_scaling_test:
  action: Apply winning hook to similar content

## Video Structure Post-Hook

After the hook captures attention, maintain engagement:

```
HOOK (0-5s)
↓
QUALIFICAÇÃO (5-15s)
"Isso é para você se..."
↓
PROBLEMA/DOR (15-45s)
Agite o problema
↓
SOLUÇÃO/BIG IDEA (45-90s)
Apresente o mecanismo
↓
PROVA (90-120s)
Depoimentos, números
↓
OFERTA (120-180s)
O que recebe, preço
↓
CTA (180s+)
O que fazer agora
```

## Hormozi Hook Patterns

> **Fonte:** `02_VALUE_EQUATION_ENGINE.md`, `01_FRAMEWORKS_OPERACIONAIS.md`

### Value Equation Aplicada a Video Hooks

A mesma equação que maximiza valor de ofertas também define hooks eficazes:

```
Valor do Hook = (Dream Outcome × Perceived Likelihood)
                ÷ (Time Delay × Effort Required)
```

**Tradução para Hooks:**
- **Dream Outcome:** A transformação prometida no hook
- **Perceived Likelihood:** Provas e especificidade que geram crença
- **Time Delay:** Quão rápido o viewer sente que conseguirá o resultado
- **Effort:** Quão fácil parece alcançar o resultado

### Enquadramento por Status (Hook Tática Mestra)

O princípio mais poderoso do Hormozi aplicado a hooks:

> "As pessoas não compram produtos; elas compram um futuro melhor. O Resultado dos Sonhos está fundamentalmente ligado ao **aumento de status** percebido."
> [Fonte: 02_VALUE_EQUATION_ENGINE.md, Seção 3.1]

**Aplicação em Hooks:**

| Hook Fraco (Benefício Direto) | Hook Forte (Enquadramento de Status) |
|------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| "Aprenda a fazer mais vendas" | "Seus concorrentes vão perguntar o que você fez diferente" |
| "Perca 10kg em 30 dias" | "Todos vão perguntar: 'O que você fez?'" |
| "Ganhe mais dinheiro" | "Imagine a cara do seu chefe quando você sair" |

**Template de Hook por Status:**
```
"Quando você [resultado], [pessoas] vão [reação de status]...
eles vão perguntar [pergunta de curiosidade]...
só você vai saber [o segredo]."
```

[Fonte: 02_VALUE_EQUATION_ENGINE.md, Seção 3.1]

### Hooks de Especificidade (Precificação por Nicho)

O framework de precificação por nicho do Hormozi se aplica a hooks:

> "A especialização permite cobrar preços exponencialmente mais altos... o valor percebido aumenta com a relevância."
> [Fonte: 01_FRAMEWORKS_OPERACIONAIS.md, Seção 5.2]

| Hook Genérico (Baixo Engagement) | Hook Hiper-Específico (Alto Engagement) |
|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| "Dicas para empreendedores" | "Para coaches que faturam entre [FAIXA_DE_RECEITA_MENSAL] por mês" |
| "Como ter mais clientes" | "3 estratégias para advogados B2B fecharem contratos de [TICKET_CONTRATO_EXEMPLO]+" |
| "Melhore seu marketing" | "O sistema que agências de tráfego usam para ROAS 5:1+" |

**Fórmula de Hook Específico:**
```
"Se você é [AVATAR ULTRA-ESPECÍFICO] que quer [RESULTADO ESPECÍFICO]..."
```

[Fonte: 01_FRAMEWORKS_OPERACIONAIS.md, Seção 5.2]

### Hooks de Prova Social (Probabilidade Percebida)

> "As pessoas pagam por **certeza**. Uma promessa ousada sem prova gera ceticismo."
> [Fonte: 02_VALUE_EQUATION_ENGINE.md, Seção 3.2]

**Hooks com Números Específicos:**
```
"[RESULTADO_EM_23_DIAS] em 23 dias usando este método."
"De 0 a 100.000 seguidores em 6 meses."
"87% dos coaches estão cometendo este erro."
"3 passos. 15 minutos. Transformação completa."
```

**Hooks com Prova de Resultado:**
```
"O sistema exato que gerou [RESULTADO_AGREGADO_EXEMPLO] para meus clientes."
"Isso funcionou para 500+ negócios - aqui está o padrão."
"ROAS de 36:1. Aqui está como."
```

[Fonte: 02_VALUE_EQUATION_ENGINE.md, Seção 3.2]

### Hooks de "Rápido Supera Grátis"

> "A diminuição do atraso temporal, tanto real quanto percebido, aumenta exponencialmente o valor."
> [Fonte: 02_VALUE_EQUATION_ENGINE.md, Seção 3.3]

**Hooks de Velocidade:**
```
"Nos próximos 60 segundos, vou te mostrar..."
"Uma mudança. Resultados em 24 horas."
"O atalho que leva 3 minutos para implementar."
"Vitória rápida: faça isso HOJE."
```

**Hooks de Imediatismo:**
```
"Você pode usar isso AGORA MESMO."
"Resultado instantâneo. Sem espera."
"Comece a ver diferença ainda hoje."
```

[Fonte: 02_VALUE_EQUATION_ENGINE.md, Seção 3.3]

### Hooks de Baixo Esforço (DFY/DWY)

> "O valor aumenta drasticamente à medida que se move de 'Faça Você Mesmo' para 'Feito Com Você' e 'Feito Para Você'."
> [Fonte: 02_VALUE_EQUATION_ENGINE.md, Seção 3.4]

**Hooks de Facilidade:**
```
"Copie e cole. Nada mais."
"Eu fiz todo o trabalho difícil por você."
"Zero esforço. Resultados máximos."
"A versão preguiçosa de [resultado]."
```

**Hooks de Simplicidade:**
```
"UMA única coisa que muda tudo."
"O método mais simples que já vi."
"Esqueça tudo que você aprendeu - isso é mais fácil."
```

[Fonte: 02_VALUE_EQUATION_ENGINE.md, Seção 3.4]

### Hooks "Grand Slam" (5 Componentes)

Uma Grand Slam Offer combina 5 elementos. Um hook pode enfatizar qualquer um:

| Componente | Exemplo de Hook |
|------------|-----------------|
| **Promoção Atraente** | "A única oferta que existe para [avatar específico]" |
| **Proposta Incomparável** | "Ninguém mais está fazendo isso assim" |
| **Preço Premium Justificado** | "Por que cobro 10x mais (e meus clientes agradecem)" |
| **Garantia Imbatível** | "Se não funcionar, eu te pago [VALOR_GARANTIA_EXEMPLO] do meu bolso" |
| **Modelo de Dinheiro** | "Como sou pago para adquirir novos clientes" |

[Fonte: 01_FRAMEWORKS_OPERACIONAIS.md, Seção 3.3]

### Hook Framework: More. Better. Different.

Aplique a estratégia de aquisição do Hormozi para criar hooks:

| Estratégia | Tipo de Hook |
|------------|--------------|
| **MAIS** | "Faça mais do que já funciona - aqui está o que funciona" |
| **MELHOR** | "O mesmo método, 10x mais eficiente" |
| **DIFERENTE** | "Esqueça tudo isso - aqui está o que realmente funciona" |

**Hooks "DIFERENTE" (mais virais):**
```
"Tudo que você aprendeu sobre [tema] está errado."
"Enquanto todos fazem X, os top 1% fazem Y."
"O método que 'eles' não querem que você saiba."
```

[Fonte: 01_FRAMEWORKS_OPERACIONAIS.md, Seção 5.5]

### Hooks C.L.O.S.E.R. para Vídeos de Vendas

Adapte o framework de vendas para hooks de VSL:

| Letra | Hook Correspondente |
|-------|-------------------|
| **C - Clarify** | "Se você está aqui, é porque quer [resultado]..." |
| **L - Label** | "Você está travado em [problema específico], certo?" |
| **O - Overview** | "Você já tentou [solução comum] e não funcionou..." |
| **S - Sell** | "O que vou mostrar é diferente de tudo que você viu." |
| **E - Explain** | "E vou te explicar EXATAMENTE por que funciona." |
| **R - Reinforce** | "Isso já funcionou para [número] pessoas como você." |

[Fonte: 01_FRAMEWORKS_OPERACIONAIS.md, Seção 6.1]

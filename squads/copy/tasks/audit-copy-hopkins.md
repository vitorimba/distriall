# Audit Copy - Hopkins Scientific Method

## Purpose

Scientific copy audit based on Claude Hopkins' principles from "Scientific Advertising" (1923). This is the FINAL audit gate before any copy goes live. Hopkins invented the rigorous, measurable approach to advertising that separates profitable copy from expensive guessing.

## When to Use

- **ALWAYS** - As the final checkpoint before publishing ANY copy
- Before A/B testing (validate fundamentals first)
- When copy is converting but you don't know why
- When copy isn't converting and you need diagnosis
- Before scaling ad spend on a winner
- When team disagrees on copy direction (data beats opinions)

## Hopkins' Core Audit Principles

```
"The only purpose of advertising is to make sales.
It is profitable or unprofitable according to its actual sales."
- Claude Hopkins, Scientific Advertising

AUDIT PHILOSOPHY:
1. Every claim must be provable
2. Every element must be testable
3. Every result must be measurable
4. Specificity beats generality ALWAYS
5. Service sells, pitching repels
```

## Inputs

```yaml
required:
  - copy_text: The full copy to audit (headline, body, CTA, offer)
  - copy_type: sales_page | email | ad | landing_page | vsl_script
  - product_name: What is being sold
  - target_audience: Who this is written for

optional:
  - current_metrics: CTR, conversion rate, AOV if available
  - tracking_codes: Existing UTMs or coupon codes
  - test_history: Previous versions tested
  - competitor_copy: What competitors are saying
```

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Salesmanship Test

Hopkins said: "Advertising is salesmanship. Its principles are the principles of salesmanship."

```
SALESMANSHIP AUDIT:

Would a salesperson say this face-to-face?

□ CONVERSATIONAL TONE
  - Reads like one person talking to another?
  - No corporate speak or jargon?
  - Could be spoken aloud naturally?
  Score: ___/10

  FAIL EXAMPLES:
  - "Leveraging synergies to optimize outcomes" (corporate)
  - "We are excited to announce" (no one talks like this)
  - "Solutions for your needs" (vague and generic)

  PASS EXAMPLES:
  - "Here's how to save $847 on your next order"
  - "I want to show you something that took me 3 years to figure out"
  - "You know that feeling when..."

□ SINGLE READER FOCUS
  - Written to ONE specific person?
  - Uses "you" more than "we/our/us"?
  - Addresses THEIR situation specifically?
  Score: ___/10

  Hopkins: "Don't think of people in the mass.
  That gives you a blurred view."

□ SELF-INTEREST ALIGNMENT
  - 100% focused on reader's benefit?
  - No self-congratulation about company?
  - Answers "What's in it for me?"
  Score: ___/10

  Hopkins: "Remember the people you address are selfish,
  as we all are. They care nothing about your interests or profit."

□ SELLING NOT ENTERTAINING
  - Purpose is conversion, not applause?
  - No clever wordplay that obscures message?
  - Entertainment value serves the sale?
  Score: ___/10

  Hopkins: "Ads are not written to entertain.
  Entertainment seekers are rarely the people you want."

SALESMANSHIP SCORE: ___/40
```

### Phase 2: Reason Why Audit

Hopkins said: "If a claim is worth making, make it in the most impressive way - by explaining WHY."

```
REASON WHY AUDIT:

Does every claim have a "Because..."?

□ CLAIM INVENTORY
  List all claims made in copy:

  Claim 1: _______________________
  Reason Why: ____________________
  Proof: ________________________

  Claim 2: _______________________
  Reason Why: ____________________
  Proof: ________________________

  Claim 3: _______________________
  Reason Why: ____________________
  Proof: ________________________

  (Continue for all claims)

□ REASON WHY COMPLETENESS
  - Every claim has explanation of WHY it's true?
  - Process/mechanism is revealed?
  - Reader can verify or understand the logic?
  Score: ___/10

  FAIL: "Our product is the purest"
  PASS: "We filter through 7 stages, including reverse osmosis at 0.0001 microns,
         removing 99.97% of contaminants - here's the lab report"

□ SCHLITZ PRINCIPLE APPLIED
  - Processes everyone does are EXPLAINED as if unique?
  - Common practices made interesting through detail?
  - "Behind the scenes" revealed?
  Score: ___/10

  Hopkins' Schlitz insight: Every brewery purified their beer.
  Hopkins explained HOW Schlitz did it (live steam, 245°).
  Result: 5th place to tied for 1st.

□ DIFFERENTIATION THROUGH EXPLANATION
  - Copy shows WHY this is different (not just claims it)?
  - Reader understands the mechanism?
  - Uniqueness is credible and specific?
  Score: ___/10

REASON WHY SCORE: ___/40
```

### Phase 3: Specificity Audit

Hopkins said: "Platitudes and generalities roll off the human understanding like water from a duck."

```
SPECIFICITY AUDIT:

Are claims precise or vague?

□ GENERALITY DETECTION
  Search for and flag these weak terms:

  [ ] "Fast" - Replace with: _________
  [ ] "Effective" - Replace with: _________
  [ ] "Many" - Replace with: _________
  [ ] "Several" - Replace with: _________
  [ ] "Affordable" - Replace with: _________
  [ ] "Premium" - Replace with: _________

  Generality Count: ___
  Target: 0

□ NUMBER SPECIFICITY
  - Uses exact numbers vs rounded? (37.4% not "about 40%")
  - Odd numbers used? (47 not 50, 2,847 not "about 3,000")
  - Source for numbers cited?
  Score: ___/10

  Hopkins: "Numbers build credibility.
  Round numbers look guessed. Exact numbers look measured."

□ TIME SPECIFICITY
  - Exact timeframes given? ("4 days" not "fast")

  - Deadlines are precise? ("11:59pm EST Jan 15" not "limited time")
  Score: ___/10

□ RESULT SPECIFICITY
  - Outcomes are measurable? ("37% increase" not "better")
  - Examples include specifics? (name, place, amount)
  - Testimonials have concrete details?
  Score: ___/10

## Hopkins' Final Words

```
"The compass of accurate knowledge directs
the shortest, safest, cheapest course."

"Guessing is not advertising. Testing is."

Before you publish, ask:
1. Can I measure this?
2. Can I test variations?
3. Can I prove my claims?
4. Would a salesperson say this face-to-face?

If any answer is NO, fix it first.

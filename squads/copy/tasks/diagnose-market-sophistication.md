# Diagnose Market Sophistication - Schwartz Method

## Purpose

Diagnose the market's sophistication stage using Eugene Schwartz's 5 Stages framework from "Breakthrough Advertising" (1966). This determines HOW to position your message within the prospect's awareness level.

## When to Use

- **After awareness level diagnosis** - This is the second diagnostic step
- When entering established markets with competitors
- When copy isn't standing out despite good awareness match
- When competitors are using similar claims
- When market feels "tired" of typical messaging
- When relaunching/repositioning products

## Schwartz on Sophistication

```
"Markets evolve. The first person to make a claim owns it.
The second person to make that claim must enlarge it.
The third must bring proof.
The fourth must develop a new mechanism.
The fifth must identify with the prospect completely.

Know where your market stands on this spectrum
before you write a word."

— Eugene Schwartz, Breakthrough Advertising (1966)
```

## The 5 Stages of Sophistication

```
SOPHISTICATION EVOLUTION:

STAGE 5: COMPLETELY SKEPTICAL ──────────────────────┐
"They've heard it all, believe none of it"          │
- Cynical about claims                              │
- Need identity/emotional connection                │
                                                    │
STAGE 4: TIRED OF MECHANISMS ───────────────────────│
"Unique mechanisms no longer unique"                │
- Market flooded with "proprietary systems"         │
- Need to identify with prospect deeply             │
                                                    │
STAGE 3: MECHANISM REQUIRED ────────────────────────│
"Claims need explanation of HOW"                    │
- Generic claims no longer work                     │
- Need unique mechanism/process                     │
                                                    │
STAGE 2: CLAIMS ENLARGEMENT ────────────────────────│
"First claim has been made, must top it"            │
- "Lose weight" → "Lose weight FAST"                │
- Competition on claim size                         │
                                                    │
STAGE 1: VIRGIN MARKET ─────────────────────────────┘
"No one has made this promise before"
- Simple, direct claim works
- First mover advantage
```

## Inputs

```yaml
required:
  - product_name: What you're selling
  - target_market: Who you're selling to
  - main_claim: Your primary benefit/promise
  - awareness_level: From diagnose-awareness-level.md

optional:
  - competitor_claims: What competitors are saying
  - market_age: How long has this market existed
  - failed_approaches: What hasn't worked
  - winning_controls: Successful copy in this market
```

## Workflow

### Step 1: Assess Competitive Landscape

```
COMPETITIVE CLAIM AUDIT:

1. LIST MAJOR COMPETITORS (5-10):
   Competitor 1: _____________ Claim: _____________
   Competitor 2: _____________ Claim: _____________
   Competitor 3: _____________ Claim: _____________
   Competitor 4: _____________ Claim: _____________
   Competitor 5: _____________ Claim: _____________

2. COMMON CLAIMS IN MARKET:
   □ What claims appear repeatedly?
   □ What phrases/words are overused?
   □ What mechanisms are everyone claiming?

3. MARKET HISTORY:
   □ How old is this market/category?
   □ What claims were made first?
   □ How have claims evolved over time?
```

### Step 2: Diagnose Each Stage

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
STAGE 1: VIRGIN MARKET
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

DEFINITION:
Your product is the first to make this type of promise.
No one has claimed this benefit before in this market.
You can be simple and direct.

DIAGNOSTIC QUESTIONS:
□ Is this a new category/solution?
□ Has NO ONE made this specific promise before?
□ Can you state the benefit simply and be believed?
□ Is there little/no direct competition?

EXAMPLES:
- First electric car company (just say "electric, no gas")
- First AI writing tool (just say "AI writes for you")
- First meal kit delivery (just say "meals delivered ready to cook")

IF YES → STAGE 1 CONFIRMED

COPY STRATEGY:
Simply state the claim. Be direct. Don't overcomplicate.
"Lose 10 pounds" - when NO ONE else offers weight loss.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
STAGE 2: CLAIMS ENLARGEMENT
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

DEFINITION:
Someone has made your claim before. Now you must ENLARGE it.
Make it faster, bigger, easier, more certain.

DIAGNOSTIC QUESTIONS:
□ Are there 1-3 direct competitors making similar claims?
□ Are prospects comparing based on "who promises more"?
□ Is the market still growing/discovering solutions?
□ Do bigger/faster/easier claims still work?

EXAMPLES:
- "Lose 10 pounds" has been claimed...
  → Now claim: "Lose 10 pounds in 30 days"
  → Then: "Lose 10 pounds in 2 weeks"
  → Then: "Lose 10 pounds in 10 days - guaranteed"

IF YES → STAGE 2 CONFIRMED

COPY STRATEGY:
Enlarge the claim. Add speed, ease, certainty.
Outpromise (credibly) the competition.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
STAGE 3: MECHANISM REQUIRED
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

DEFINITION:
Claims have been enlarged so many times, nobody believes
"just claims" anymore. You need to explain HOW it works.
You need a unique MECHANISM.

DIAGNOSTIC QUESTIONS:
□ Are there many competitors making enlarged claims?
□ Has the market become skeptical of "just promises"?
□ Do prospects ask "but HOW does it work?"
□ Do winners in this market have "proprietary methods"?

EXAMPLES:
- "Lose 10 pounds fast" no longer works...
  → Need mechanism: "The Keto Metabolic Switch"
  → Or: "The 16:8 Intermittent Fasting Protocol"
  → Or: "The Hormone Reset Method"

IF YES → STAGE 3 CONFIRMED

COPY STRATEGY:
Introduce a UNIQUE MECHANISM. Name it. Explain the science.
Make the HOW more important than the WHAT.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
STAGE 4: TIRED OF MECHANISMS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

DEFINITION:
Everyone has a "unique mechanism" now. The market is flooded
with proprietary methods. New mechanisms don't stand out.
You must now IDENTIFY with the prospect personally.

DIAGNOSTIC QUESTIONS:
□ Does everyone have their own "system" or "method"?
□ Are mechanisms starting to sound the same?
□ Is the market becoming cynical about "new discoveries"?
□ Do prospects care more about WHO than HOW?

EXAMPLES:
- Every diet has a "system" now...
  → Need identification: "The busy mom's solution"
  → Or: "For men over 40 who hate gyms"
  → Or: "By someone who was exactly where you are"

IF YES → STAGE 4 CONFIRMED

COPY STRATEGY:
Identify deeply with the prospect. Make them feel understood.
Your mechanism matters less than showing you KNOW them.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
STAGE 5: COMPLETELY SKEPTICAL
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

DEFINITION:
Market has seen EVERYTHING. Claims, enlarged claims, mechanisms,
identification - all have been tried. They're cynical about
everything. You must connect emotionally/identity-based.

DIAGNOSTIC QUESTIONS:
□ Has this market been saturated for years/decades?
□ Do prospects roll their eyes at all marketing?
□ Has every angle/approach been tried?
□ Is the only path through authentic relationship?

EXAMPLES:
- Weight loss market is FULLY Stage 5...
  → Need: Emotional/identity-based connection
  → "This isn't about weight. It's about the life you deserve."
  → Celebrity/influencer endorsements that feel authentic
  → Community-based approaches

IF YES → STAGE 5 CONFIRMED

COPY STRATEGY:
Lead with emotion, identity, and relationship.
Claims become secondary to WHO you are and HOW you connect.
```

COPY STRATEGY BY STAGE:

┌─────────┬────────────────────┬────────────────────────────────────┐
│ STAGE   │ HEADLINE FOCUS     │ BODY COPY FOCUS                    │

└─────────┴────────────────────┴────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Step 5: Headline Templates by Stage

```
STAGE 1 (VIRGIN) HEADLINES:

- Simple: "Now you can [achieve result]"
- Announcement: "Introducing: [benefit] for [audience]"

STAGE 2 (ENLARGEMENT) HEADLINES:
- Speed: "[Benefit] in [faster time]"
- Ease: "[Benefit] without [hard thing]"
- Certainty: "[Guaranteed benefit] or [risk reversal]"
- Amount: "[More benefit] than [competitor/alternative]"

STAGE 3 (MECHANISM) HEADLINES:
- Named mechanism: "The [Mechanism Name] that [benefit]"
- Discovery: "New [scientific term] [achieves benefit]"
- Process: "The [number]-step [method] that [benefit]"
- Science: "Harvard/MIT/Doctor discovers [mechanism]"

STAGE 4 (IDENTIFICATION) HEADLINES:
- Audience specific: "For [specific person] who [specific situation]"
- Empathy: "If you've tried everything and nothing works..."
- Understanding: "Finally, someone who gets [your situation]"
- Story: "I was exactly where you are when..."

STAGE 5 (EMOTION/IDENTITY) HEADLINES:
- Transformation: "This isn't about [surface thing]..."
- Belonging: "Join [number] people who [identity]"
- Values: "For those who believe [value/identity]"
- Movement: "The [movement name] changing [industry]"
```

## Common Mistakes

```
MISTAKE 1: Stage 1 Copy in Stage 3+ Market
- Symptom: "Get [benefit]" - simple claim ignored
- Fix: Add mechanism to differentiate

MISTAKE 2: Stage 3 Mechanism in Stage 5 Market
- Symptom: New mechanism gets eye rolls
- Fix: Lead with identity/emotion, mechanism secondary

MISTAKE 3: Inventing Mechanism When Not Needed
- Symptom: Overcomplicating in Stage 1-2 market
- Fix: Sometimes simple is best. Trust the stage.

MISTAKE 4: Ignoring Awareness × Sophistication
- Symptom: Right sophistication, wrong awareness
- Fix: Always combine both diagnoses

# Task: Create Evergreen Launch

> **Framework**: Product Launch Formula (Jeff Walker)
> **Agent**: @jeff-walker
> **Launch Type**: Evergreen Launch
> **Output**: Complete automated evergreen funnel system

---

## Purpose

Transform a proven live launch into an automated evergreen system that runs continuously. Evergreen launches bring new prospects through the full PLF experience on their own timeline, generating consistent revenue without live launches.

---

## What is an Evergreen Launch?

> "An Evergreen Launch takes everything that worked in your live launch and automates it so you can make sales every single day, even while you sleep." - Jeff Walker

**Key characteristics:**
- Automated version of proven live launch
- Each subscriber gets personalized timeline
- Deadline is real but individualized
- Runs 24/7/365
- Requires proven live launch first

---

## Prerequisites

- [ ] Completed at least ONE successful live launch
- [ ] Conversion data from live launch
- [ ] Recorded PLC content (or filmed for evergreen)
- [ ] Sales page with proven conversion
- [ ] Email automation platform capable of date-based sequences
- [ ] Deadline/scarcity tool

---

## Workflow Steps

### Step 1: Gather Context

**Elicit from user:**
```
1. Have you done a live launch of this offer? Results?
2. What was your conversion rate? (% of buyers)
3. Do you have recorded PLCs or need to create them?
4. What email platform are you using?
5. How will you handle deadlines? (countdown tool?)
6. What's your traffic source for the funnel?
7. What's your target daily/monthly revenue?
```

### Step 2: Validate Evergreen Readiness

**Ready for evergreen if:**
- [ ] Live launch conversion: 2%+ of engaged list
- [ ] PLC content recorded or filmable
- [ ] Email automation can handle dynamic dates
- [ ] Have deadline/scarcity tool (Deadline Funnel, etc.)
- [ ] Consistent traffic source available

**NOT ready if:**
- Never launched live (unproven offer)
- Conversion rate unknown
- No automated deadline solution
- No traffic source planned

**Reference:**
- `checklists/plf/evergreen-setup.md`

### Step 3: Plan Evergreen Architecture

**Core components:**

```
[Traffic] → [Opt-in] → [Evergreen PLC Sequence] → [Sales Page] → [Checkout]
                              ↓
                    [Deadline System]
                              ↓
                    [Cart Close/Offer Expired]
```

**Timeline options:**

| Model | PLC Duration | Cart Open | Total |
|-------|--------------|-----------|-------|
| Compressed | 3 days | 4 days | 7 days |
| Standard | 5-7 days | 5 days | 10-12 days |
| Extended | 10 days | 7 days | 17 days |

### Step 4: Convert PLCs to Evergreen Format

**For each PLC:**

1. **Review live version**
   - Identify dated references
   - Note live-only elements
   - List urgency language

2. **Adapt for evergreen**
   - Remove specific dates
   - Change "tomorrow" to "in your next video"
   - Update urgency to countdown-based
   - Remove live chat references

3. **Record or edit**
   - Film new version OR
   - Edit existing to remove dated content

**Evergreen PLC language:**
```
Instead of: "Tomorrow I'll share..."
Use: "In your next video, you'll discover..."

Instead of: "This Thursday at 8pm..."
Use: "In just a few days, the doors open..."

Instead of: "We had 500 people join yesterday"
Use: "Thousands of people have used this system..."
```

### Step 5: Build Email Automation Sequence

**Evergreen email sequence:**

| Day | Email | Focus |
|-----|-------|-------|
| 0 | Welcome + PLC1 Access | Orientation |
| 1 | PLC1 Reminder | Engagement |
| 2 | PLC2 Access | Progression |
| 3 | PLC2 Reminder | Engagement |
| 4 | PLC3 Access | Anticipation |
| 5 | PLC3 Reminder + "Tomorrow" | Build-up |
| 6 | Doors Open | Cart open |
| 7 | Social Proof | Middle cart |
| 8 | Objection | Middle cart |
| 9 | Final Day Warning | Urgency |
| 10 | 12 Hours Left | Strong urgency |
| 11 | 3 Hours Left | Maximum urgency |
| 12 | Last Chance | Final push |
| 13 | Doors Closed | Post-close |

**Buyer path:**
- Remove from sequence immediately
- Add to customer onboarding
- Do NOT continue cart emails

### Step 6: Set Up Deadline System

**Deadline technology options:**

| Tool | Features | Price |
|------|----------|-------|
| Deadline Funnel | Cookies + email + page | $49-99/mo |
| Thrive Ultimatum | WP plugin, basic | One-time |
| CartFlows | WooCommerce integrated | Varies |
| Custom dev | Full control | Dev time |

**Deadline rules:**
1. Deadline starts when they opt in
2. Timer syncs across emails and pages
3. Deadline is REAL (page actually closes)
4. No resets or extensions
5. After deadline: evergreen closed page

**Setup steps:**
- [ ] Install deadline tool
- [ ] Configure tracking
- [ ] Sync with email platform
- [ ] Test full sequence
- [ ] Verify page lockout works

### Step 7: Create Evergreen Pages

**Required pages:**

1. **Opt-in Page**
   - Lead magnet or PLC access offer
   - Trigger for deadline timer start

2. **PLC Pages (3)**
   - Embedded video
   - Engagement elements
   - Next step CTA

3. **Sales Page**
   - Timer visible
   - Dynamic deadline display
   - Standard sales page elements

4. **Checkout Page**
   - Timer visible
   - Urgency maintained
   - Clean checkout process

5. **Closed/Expired Page**
   - Acknowledges deadline passed
   - Waitlist option
   - Alternative offer (optional)

### Step 8: Plan Traffic Strategy

**Evergreen traffic sources:**

| Source | Type | Scalability |
|--------|------|-------------|
| Paid Ads | Active | High |
| SEO/Content | Passive | Medium |
| Social Media | Active | Medium |
| Affiliates | Passive | High |
| Podcast/Guest | Active | Medium |

**Traffic to revenue math:**
```
Opt-in rate: [X]%
PLC engagement: [X]%
Conversion rate: [X]%
Average order value: R$[X]

Example:
1,000 visitors → 300 opt-ins (30%)
300 opt-ins → 150 engaged (50%)
150 engaged → 5 sales (3.3%)
5 sales × [PREÇO_EXEMPLO] = [RECEITA_TOTAL_EXEMPLO]

Cost per opt-in target: < R$[X]
```

### Step 9: Build Monitoring Dashboard

**Key metrics to track:**

| Metric | Target | Frequency |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| Opt-in rate | 25-40% | Daily |
| PLC1 view rate | 60%+ | Weekly |
| PLC2 view rate | 40%+ | Weekly |
| PLC3 view rate | 30%+ | Weekly |
| Cart visit rate | 20%+ | Weekly |
| Conversion rate | 2-5% | Weekly |
| Revenue/opt-in | R$[X] | Monthly |

**Review cadence:**
- Daily: Traffic and opt-ins
- Weekly: Engagement and conversions
- Monthly: Revenue and optimization

### Step 10: Plan Optimization Cycle

**Ongoing optimization:**

1. **Email optimization**
   - Subject line testing
   - Open rate improvement
   - Click rate improvement

2. **Page optimization**
   - Opt-in page conversion
   - Sales page conversion
   - Checkout completion

3. **Content optimization**
   - PLC engagement rates
   - Watch time analysis
   - Drop-off points

4. **Traffic optimization**
   - Source performance
   - Cost per acquisition
   - Quality of leads

### Step 11: Validate Evergreen Setup

**Run checklist:**
- `checklists/plf/evergreen-setup.md`

**Launch checklist:**
- [ ] All emails loaded and tested
- [ ] Deadline system working
- [ ] Pages live and functioning
- [ ] Checkout tested with real transaction
- [ ] Buyer removal from sequence working
- [ ] Analytics tracking in place

---

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Funnel runs without manual intervention
- [ ] Deadlines work correctly (page closes)
- [ ] Conversion rate: Within 50% of live launch
- [ ] Revenue: Consistent daily/weekly
- [ ] No customer complaints about fake scarcity
- [ ] Optimization showing improvements

---

## Evergreen Ethics

**The scarcity MUST be real:**
- Deadline enforced by technology
- No manual overrides or extensions
- Clear policy on missed deadlines
- Transparent about how it works

**Jeff's principle:**
> "The key to evergreen is that the deadline has to be just as real as in a live launch. If people can come back and buy whenever they want, it's not a launch - it's just a sales page."

---

## Common Evergreen Mistakes

1. **Fake scarcity** - Deadline resets or can be bypassed
2. **No traffic plan** - Built it but no one comes
3. **Never optimize** - Set and forget forever
4. **Skip live launch** - Go straight to evergreen (unproven)
5. **Ignore metrics** - Not tracking what matters

---

## After Evergreen Launch

**Ongoing:**
1. Monitor metrics weekly
2. Run optimization tests
3. Scale winning traffic sources
4. Collect new testimonials
5. Consider periodic "live" events to boost

**Relaunch consideration:**
- Annual or semi-annual live launch
- Updates to content and offer
- Fresh testimonials and cases

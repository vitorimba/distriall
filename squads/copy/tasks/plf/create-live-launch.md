# Task: Create Live Launch Plan

> **Framework**: Product Launch Formula (Jeff Walker)
> **Agent**: @jeff-walker
> **Launch Type**: Live Launch
> **Output**: Complete live event integrated launch strategy

---

## Purpose

Design a Live Launch that incorporates real-time events (webinars, workshops, challenges) into the PLF framework. Live elements amplify engagement, create events, and drive urgency through scheduled experiences.

---

## What is a Live Launch?

> "Adding live elements to your launch creates real events that people don't want to miss. It's the difference between watching a movie at home and going to the premiere." - Jeff Walker

**Key characteristics:**
- Scheduled live events during launch
- Real-time interaction with audience
- Creates genuine scarcity (live = now or never)
- Higher engagement and conversion
- Requires more coordination

---

## Live Launch Formats

| Format | Duration | Best For | Complexity |
|--------|----------|----------|------------|
| Webinar Series | 60-90 min x 3 | Teaching-based offers | Medium |
| Live Workshop | 2-4 hours x 1-3 | Hands-on skills | Medium |
| 5-Day Challenge | 30-60 min x 5 | List building + launch | High |
| Launch Event | 1 day intensive | Premium offers | High |
| Hybrid PLC | Videos + Live Q&A | Any offer | Low-Medium |

## Prerequisites

- [ ] Comfortable presenting live
- [ ] Webinar/streaming platform ready
- [ ] Reliable internet connection
- [ ] Product/offer finalized

## Workflow Steps

### Step 1: Gather Context

**Elicit from user:**
```
1. What live format appeals to you? (webinar, workshop, challenge)
2. Are you comfortable presenting live?
3. What platform will you use? (Zoom, WebinarJam, etc.)
4. How many live events do you want to do?
5. Will you have team support during lives?
6. What's your replay strategy?
7. What timezone is your primary audience?
```

### Step 2: Select Live Launch Format

**Format decision tree:**

```
Are you comfortable with long live sessions?
├─ Yes → Workshop or Challenge
└─ No → Webinar Series or Hybrid

Is your audience global (multiple timezones)?
├─ Yes → Hybrid (lives + replays) or Multiple times
└─ No → Single timezone scheduling

What's your team capacity?
├─ Solo → Webinar Series or Hybrid
└─ Team → Any format
```

### Step 3: Design Live Event Structure

**Option A: 3-Part Webinar Series (replaces PLCs)**

| Event | Focus | Duration | Day |
|-------|-------|----------|-----|
| Webinar 1 | Opportunity + Teaching | 75 min | Day 1 |

| Day 1 | Foundation + Quick Win | Live training | 45 min |
| Day 2 | Deep Dive #1 | Live training | 45 min |
| Day 3 | Deep Dive #2 | Live training | 45 min |
| Day 4 | Implementation | Live workshop | 60 min |
| Day 5 | Offer + Q&A | Live pitch | 75 min |

**Option C: Hybrid PLCs + Live Q&As**

| Component | Format | Day |
|-----------|--------|-----|
| PLC1 | Recorded video | Day 1 |

| PLC2 | Recorded video | Day 3 |
| Live Q&A #2 | Live session | Day 4 |

### Step 4: Create Live Event Content

**For each live event, create:**

   - Interaction points (polls, Q&A)
   - Transition to next step/offer

2. **Slide Deck** (if applicable)

   - Agenda
   - Content slides
   - Offer/pitch slides (for final event)

3. **Host Notes**
   - Talking points
   - Timing reminders
   - Q&A prompts
   - Technical instructions

### Step 5: Plan Live Event Technology

   - Price reveal
   - Bonuses
   - Guarantee
   - Close

4. **Q&A** (remaining time)

- Let Q&A run indefinitely
- Forget to record

## After the Live Launch

**Post-event:**
1. Send replay immediately
2. Follow up with non-attendees
3. Continue cart sequence
4. Answer questions from chat

|-------|----------|-----------------|
| Pre-Prelaunch | 3-5 | Build anticipation, survey |

If that resonates, here's the link:

### Step 6: Create Final Day Emails

**Last Day Warning:**
```
Subject: ⚠️ Last day

[NAME],

This is your final reminder.

[PRODUCT NAME] closes tonight at [TIME].

After that, I honestly don't know when (or if)
I'll open it again.

What you get:
[QUICK RECAP]

Closes tonight: [LINK]

Clock is ticking.

[YOUR NAME]
```

**Final Call:**
```
Subject: Closing in 2 hours

[NAME],

This is it.

In 2 hours, [PRODUCT] closes.

If you've been on the fence, now is the time to decide.

[LINK]

Thank you for being here throughout this journey.

Whatever you decide, I appreciate you.

[YOUR NAME]
```

**Cart Closed:**
```
Subject: Doors closed

[NAME],

That's it.

[PRODUCT] is now closed.

Thank you to everyone who joined - I can't wait
to work with you inside.

For everyone else:

In the meantime, I'll be sharing more free content
to help you [CONTINUE TRANSFORMATION].

[YOUR NAME]
```

### Step 7: Create Post-Close Emails

**Buyer Thank You:**

```

**Non-Buyer Nurture:**

And that's totally okay.

I wanted to let you know:
- I'll continue sharing free content
- You're still part of this community
- When/if we open again, you'll be first to know

Thank you for being here.

[YOUR NAME]
```

### Step 8: Optimize Subject Lines

**Create 2-3 variations for key emails:**

| Email | Option A | Option B | Option C |
|-------|----------|----------|----------|
| PLC1 | "It's here" | "[PLC TITLE]" | "You asked, I delivered" |
| Cart Open | "Doors open" | "🚀 We're live" | "Your invitation" |
| Final Day | "Last day" | "Closing tonight" | "Final call" |
| Final Hour | "[X] hours" | "Don't miss this" | "Closing now" |

**Reference:**
- `templates/plf/email-subject-lines-tmpl.md`
- `data/plf/email-benchmarks-kb.yaml`

### Step 9: Set Up Email Segments

**Segment by engagement:**
- Opened emails only
- Clicked to PLC
- Watched all PLCs
- Visited sales page
- Started checkout
- Cart abandoned

**Tailor messaging:**
- Re-engaged sequences for non-openers
- Extra urgency for cart abandoners
- Different angles for different segments

### Step 10: Validate Complete Sequence

**Checklist:**
- [ ] All emails written
- [ ] Subject line variations ready
- [ ] Links correct
- [ ] Dates/times accurate
- [ ] Segments configured
- [ ] Test emails sent
- [ ] Mobile formatting checked

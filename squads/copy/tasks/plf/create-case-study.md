# Task: Create Case Study

> **Framework**: Product Launch Formula (Jeff Walker)
> **Agent**: @jeff-walker
> **Phase**: Pre-Launch Preparation
> **Output**: Compelling case studies for PLC2 and sales page

---

## Purpose

Develop powerful case studies that demonstrate transformation and activate social proof. Case studies are the backbone of PLC2 and essential for sales page conversion.

---

## Why Case Studies Matter

> "Your case studies are worth their weight in gold. They're not just proof - they're permission. When people see someone like them succeed, they give themselves permission to believe it's possible." - Jeff Walker

**Functions:**
- Demonstrate transformation is possible
- Address objections through stories
- Provide "people like me" connection
- Create emotional resonance
- Build credibility

---

## Prerequisites

- [ ] Access to successful customers/students
- [ ] Permission to share their story
- [ ] Specific results to document
- [ ] Interview time or written testimonial

---

## Workflow Steps

### Step 1: Gather Context

**Elicit from user:**
```
1. How many case studies do you need? (minimum 3)
2. Do you have customers with results?
3. Can you interview them? (or have written responses)
4. What types of results are most compelling?
5. What's your ideal customer profile?
6. What objections need addressing through stories?
```

### Step 2: Identify Case Study Candidates

**Ideal characteristics:**
- Similar to target avatar
- Achieved measurable results
- Articulate about their experience
- Willing to share publicly
- Represents common situation

**Candidate matrix:**

| Candidate | Avatar Similarity | Result Type | Articulate | Permission |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------|------------|------------|
| | | | | |
| | | | | |
| | | | | |

**Diversity considerations:**
- Different starting points
- Various demographics
- Range of result levels
- Different objections overcome

### Step 3: Conduct Case Study Interview

**Use template:**
- `templates/plf/case-study-tmpl.md`

**Interview questions:**

**Background:**
```
1. What was your situation before [PRODUCT]?
2. What had you tried before that didn't work?
3. What was your biggest frustration?
4. What made you decide to try this?
5. What concerns did you have before starting?
```

**Transformation:**
```
6. When did you first notice results?
7. What specific changes happened?
8. What was the most surprising outcome?
9. What's different about your daily life now?
10. Can you quantify any results? (numbers, time, money)
```

**Reflection:**
```
11. What would you tell someone who's skeptical?
12. What was the hardest part?
13. What made this different from other things you tried?
14. Would you recommend this? Why?
15. Where would you be without this change?
```

### Step 4: Extract Key Story Elements

```

**Format B: Medium (Sales Page)**

Turns out, my life experience was actually an advantage..."
```

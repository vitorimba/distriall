### Phase 4: Validation

#### Step 4.1: Trigger Distribution Check

Each trigger should appear at least twice across the sequence:

| Trigger | Pre-Pre | PLC1 | PLC2 | PLC3 | Open | Close | Total |
|---------|---------|------|------|------|------|-------|-------|
| Authority | | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | | ✓ | 4 |
| Reciprocity | | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | | | 3 |
| Trust | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | | ✓ | | 4 |
| Anticipation | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | | | 4 |
| Likability | | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | | | 3 |
| Events | | | | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | 3 |
| Community | ✓ | | ✓ | | | | 2 |
| Social Proof | | ✓ | ✓ | | ✓ | ✓ | 4 |
| Scarcity | | | | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | 3 |

#### Step 4.2: Balance Check

- No single trigger dominates
- Scarcity only at end
- Authority established early
- Social proof throughout
- Reciprocity before asking

#### Step 4.3: Authenticity Check

For each trigger activation:
- [ ] Is it genuine?
- [ ] Does it feel natural?
- [ ] Would I feel manipulated?
- [ ] Is it necessary?

## Jeff's Wisdom

> "Mental triggers aren't manipulation. They're the language
> of human psychology. You're just communicating in ways
> that resonate with how people actually make decisions."

> "The trigger that matters most is Reciprocity.
> Give first, give more, give genuinely.
> Everything else follows."

> "Scarcity without substance is manipulation.
> Scarcity WITH substance is helping people decide."

---

## Ethical Guidelines

**DO:**
- Use triggers to highlight genuine value
- Ensure scarcity is real
- Build authentic authority
- Create true community
- Deliver real reciprocity

**DON'T:**
- Manufacture fake scarcity
- Exaggerate credentials
- Fabricate testimonials
- Manipulate emotions without value
- Use fear without hope

---

## Common Mistakes

1. **Over-relying on scarcity** - Build value first
2. **Forgetting reciprocity** - Give before you ask
3. **Fake social proof** - Only use real testimonials
4. **Rushed trust** - Trust takes time to build
5. **Missing community** - People buy into tribes
6. **Weak authority** - Establish expertise early

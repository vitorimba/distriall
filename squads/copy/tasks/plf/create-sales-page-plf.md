# Task: Create PLF Sales Page

> **Framework**: Product Launch Formula (Jeff Walker)
> **Agent**: @jeff-walker
> **Phase**: Sales Page Creation
> **Output**: Complete sales page following PLF principles

---

## Purpose

Create a sales page that naturally follows from the PLC sequence. Unlike traditional long-form sales letters, PLF sales pages assume the prospect has already consumed prelaunch content and is primed to buy.

---

## PLF Sales Page Philosophy

> "Your sales page is NOT where you make the sale.
> The sale happens during the prelaunch.
> The sales page is where they complete the transaction." - Jeff Walker

**Key difference from traditional sales pages:**
- Shorter (prospect is already educated)
- Focused on offer details and logistics
- Heavy on social proof
- Clear next steps

---

- [ ] PLC sequence complete
- [ ] Launch stack finalized
- [ ] Testimonials ready
- [ ] Checkout integrated
- [ ] Template ready: `templates/plf/sales-page-blueprint-tmpl.md`
- [ ] Reference: `checklists/plf/sales-page-plf.md`

## Jeff's Wisdom

> "By the time they get to your sales page, they should
> already be sold. The page is just the final details."

> "Make it easy. Clear headline, clear offer, clear CTA.
> Don't make them think."

> "Testimonials do the heavy lifting on your sales page.
> Let your customers sell for you."

---

## Common Mistakes

1. **Too long** - PLF sales pages are shorter
2. **Repeating PLC content** - They've already seen it
3. **Weak stack presentation** - Make value crystal clear
4. **Hidden guarantee** - Make it prominent
5. **Confusing CTAs** - One clear action
6. **Slow page** - Speed kills conversions

## Handoff

After sales page complete:
→ `tasks/plf/create-open-cart-sequence.md` (link in emails)
→ `checklists/plf/launch-day-execution.md` (final checks)

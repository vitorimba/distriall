# Task: Create Seed Launch Plan

> **Framework**: Product Launch Formula (Jeff Walker)
> **Agent**: @jeff-walker
> **Output**: Complete seed launch strategy for product validation

---

## Purpose

The Seed Launch is Jeff Walker's method for validating a product idea with a small audience (100-500 people) before creating the full product. You sell first, then build based on actual customer feedback.

---

## Why Seed Launch?

> "Why spend months building something that might not sell?
> With a Seed Launch, you get paid to create your product
> while your customers help you make it better." - Jeff Walker

**Benefits:**
- Validates demand before full development
- Generates revenue during creation
- Customer feedback shapes the product
- Builds testimonials for future launches
- Low risk, high learning

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Concept Validation (Week 1)

#### Step 1.1: Define the Transformation
```
My [TYPE] will help [AVATAR] go from [CURRENT STATE] to [DESIRED STATE]
by teaching them [METHODOLOGY] over [TIMEFRAME].
```

#### Step 1.2: Create Beta Offer
```
Product Name: [NAME] - Beta/Founding Member Version
Format: [X] live calls over [X] weeks
Includes:
- Live teaching sessions
- Q&A and feedback
- Direct access to me
- [BONUS: Influence on final product]

Price: [BETA_PRICE] (vs [FUTURE_PRICE])
Spots: [X] maximum
```

#### Step 1.3: "Shot Across Bow" Email
```
Subject: Quick question + something I'm working on

Hey [Name],

I've been thinking about creating something for people
who want to [RESULT].

Before I build it, I wanted to ask you:

What's your #1 challenge when it comes to [TOPIC]?

Just hit reply and let me know. I read every response.

Thanks,
[Name]

P.S. I'm considering doing a small beta test with a
handful of people. Want me to let you know if I do?
```

---

### Phase 2: Mini Prelaunch (Week 2)

#### Step 2.1: Abbreviated PLC
For a Seed Launch, you don't need full PLCs. Instead:

**Content Piece 1 (Email/Post):**
- Share your story with the topic
- The insight that changed things
- Hint at something you're creating

**Content Piece 2 (Email/Post):**
- Teach one valuable thing
- Show your expertise
- Build anticipation for "something small"

**Content Piece 3 (Offer Email):**
- Reveal the beta program
- Limited spots (real)
- Special pricing (real)
- Start date

#### Step 2.2: Seed Launch Emails

**Email 1: The Invitation**
```
Subject: [X] spots for beta program

Hey [Name],

I mentioned I was thinking about creating something...

Well, I've decided to do a small beta test.

It's called [PRODUCT NAME], and it's for people who
want to [RESULT].

Here's what it is:
- [X] live sessions over [X] weeks
- Topic: [BRIEF DESCRIPTION]
- You'll get: [KEY OUTCOMES]

Because this is a beta, two things are different:

1. The price is [BETA_PRICE] instead of [REGULAR_PRICE]
2. I'm only taking [X] people

In exchange for the lower price, I'm asking for:
- Your feedback on the content
- A testimonial if you get results

If this sounds good, reply to this email with "I'M IN"
and I'll send you the details.

[Name]

P.S. First [X] people who reply get in. After that,
I'll start a waitlist for the full version.
```

**Email 2: Reminder**
```
Subject: [X] spots left

Quick update:

[X] people have already joined the [PRODUCT] beta.

That leaves [X] spots.

If you want in, reply "I'M IN" and I'll send the link.

Starting [DATE].

[Name]
```

**Email 3: Last Chance**
```
Subject: Closing enrollment tomorrow

This is the last call for the [PRODUCT] beta.

[X] spots remain. Enrollment closes tomorrow at [TIME].

Reply "I'M IN" if you want the details.

[Name]
```

## Checklist Validation

Apply: `checklists/plf/seed-launch-checklist.md`

## Jeff's Wisdom

> "A Seed Launch is the lowest-risk way to start a product business.
> You validate before you create. You get paid to build.
> And your customers help you make it better."

> "Don't overthink it. You don't need a big list or a perfect product.
> You need a good idea, a small group of people, and the willingness
> to show up and deliver value."

> "The testimonials and case studies you get from a Seed Launch
> are worth their weight in gold. They make every future launch easier."

---

## Common Mistakes

1. **Waiting for "enough" people** - Start with 5 if that's what you have
2. **Overcomplicating the offer** - Keep it simple, deliver live
3. **Not collecting feedback** - This is the whole point
4. **Underpricing** - Beta doesn't mean free
5. **Not asking for testimonials** - Ask early, ask often
6. **Skipping to full launch** - Do 2-3 seed launches first

---

## Handoff

After successful seed launch:
→ `tasks/plf/create-plc-sequence.md` (use testimonials)
→ `tasks/plf/create-launch-stack.md` (refine offer)
→ `tasks/plf/create-live-launch.md` (scale up)

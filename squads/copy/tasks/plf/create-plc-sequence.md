# Task: Create PLC Sequence

> **Framework**: Product Launch Formula (Jeff Walker)
> **Agent**: @jeff-walker
> **Phase**: Prelaunch
> **Output**: Complete PLC1, PLC2, PLC3 content sequence

---

## Purpose

Design and create the three Pre-Launch Content pieces that form the heart of the Product Launch Formula. Each PLC serves a specific purpose and activates different mental triggers.

---

## Prerequisites

- [ ] Pre-Prelaunch completed (survey data available)
- [ ] Product/offer fully defined
- [ ] Avatar deeply understood
- [ ] Case studies/testimonials available (for PLC2)
- [ ] Launch dates confirmed

---

## Workflow Steps

### Step 1: Gather Context

**Elicit from user:**
```
1. What are the top 3 insights from your survey?
2. What's your unique mechanism/method?
3. Do you have 3+ case studies/testimonials?
4. What's your content format preference? (video/text/audio)
5. What's your authority story?
6. What are the top 3 objections from your audience?
```

### Step 2: Design PLC Architecture

**Map the sequence:**

| PLC | Focus | Duration | Primary Trigger |
|-----|-------|----------|-----------------|
| PLC1 | The Opportunity | 15-30 min | Authority + Anticipation |
| PLC2 | The Transformation | 20-40 min | Social Proof + Reciprocity |
| PLC3 | The Ownership | 25-45 min | Anticipation + Community |

**Reference:**
- `data/plf/content-formats-kb.yaml` - Format recommendations
- `checklists/plf/plc-quality.md` - Quality standards

### Step 3: Create PLC1 - The Opportunity

**Use template:**
- `templates/plf/plc1-script-tmpl.md`

**Structure:**
1. Hook (30 seconds) - Grab attention
2. Authority/Origin story (2-3 min) - Why listen to you
3. Opportunity revealed (5-7 min) - What's possible
4. First teaching (7-10 min) - Real value
5. Anticipation for PLC2 (2-3 min) - Teaser

**Key elements:**
- [ ] Opens with curiosity/hook
- [ ] Establishes credibility without bragging
- [ ] Shows transformation possibility
- [ ] Delivers REAL value (not just teaser)
- [ ] Uses avatar's exact language
- [ ] Creates genuine anticipation for PLC2

### Step 4: Create PLC2 - The Transformation

**Use template:**
- `templates/plf/plc2-script-tmpl.md`

**Structure:**
1. Recap of PLC1 (1-2 min)
2. Main case study detailed (5-7 min)
3. Additional cases 2-3 (5 min)
4. Deeper teaching (7-10 min)
5. Objection handling (3-5 min)
6. Anticipation for PLC3 (2-3 min)

**Case study criteria:**
- [ ] Similar to target avatar
- [ ] Specific, measurable results
- [ ] Clear before/after
- [ ] Includes direct quote
- [ ] Timeline stated

**Reference:**
- `templates/plf/case-study-tmpl.md` - Case study structure

### Step 5: Create PLC3 - The Ownership

**Use template:**
- `templates/plf/plc3-script-tmpl.md`

**Structure:**
1. Recap of journey (2-3 min)
2. Ownership vision (5-7 min) - Future pacing
3. Day-in-the-life (3-5 min)
4. Final teaching (10-15 min)
5. Bridge to offer (5 min)
6. Product preview (3-5 min)
7. Scarcity/urgency setup (2-3 min)

**Ownership elements:**
- [ ] "Imagine waking up..." scenario
- [ ] Daily life transformation
- [ ] Emotional state change
- [ ] Sensory details
- [ ] Connection to their deeper goals

### Step 6: Create Email Sequences

**For each PLC, create:**
1. Announcement email (day of release)
2. Reminder email (day after)
3. "Did you see?" email (2 days after)

**Reference:**
- `data/plf/copy-swipes-kb.yaml` - Email templates
- `data/plf/email-benchmarks-kb.yaml` - Performance targets

### Step 7: Map Mental Triggers

**Validate trigger activation across PLCs:**

| Trigger | PLC1 | PLC2 | PLC3 |
|---------|------|------|------|
| Authority | ✓ | ✓ | |
| Reciprocity | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Trust | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Anticipation | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Likability | ✓ | ✓ | |
| Community | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Social Proof | ✓ | ✓ | |
| Scarcity | | | ✓ |

**Reference:**
- `checklists/plf/mental-triggers-activation.md`

### Step 8: Quality Validation

**Run checklist for each PLC:**
- `checklists/plf/plc-quality.md`

**Minimum scores:**
- PLC1: 18/23 (80%)
- PLC2: 30/37 (80%)
- PLC3: 23/29 (80%)

---

## Deliverables

1. **PLC1 Script/Outline**
   - Complete script or detailed outline
   - Email sequence (3 emails)
   - Quality score

2. **PLC2 Script/Outline**
   - Complete script with case studies
   - Email sequence (3 emails)
   - Quality score

3. **PLC3 Script/Outline**
   - Complete script with ownership vision
   - Email sequence (3 emails)
   - Quality score

4. **PLC Calendar**
   - Release dates
   - Email timing
   - Social media coordination

---

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Each PLC delivers standalone value
- [ ] Case studies are relatable and specific
- [ ] Mental triggers properly distributed
- [ ] Email open rates: 25%+ (warm list)
- [ ] Video/content completion rate: 60%+
- [ ] Comments/engagement increases each PLC

---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

**PLC1:**
- All teaser, no substance
- Authority without vulnerability
- Generic advice

**PLC2:**
- Fake or vague testimonials
- Only extreme success cases
- Ignoring objections

**PLC3:**
- Hard sell too early
- Vague about what's included
- Fake scarcity

---

## Next Steps

After PLC sequence complete:
→ `tasks/plf/create-launch-stack.md` - Build offer stack
→ `tasks/plf/create-open-cart-sequence.md` - Cart emails
→ `tasks/plf/create-sales-page-plf.md` - Sales page

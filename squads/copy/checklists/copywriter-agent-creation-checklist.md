# Copywriter Agent Creation Checklist

## Purpose

Comprehensive validation checklist for copywriter agent creation using the CopywriterOS pipeline. Use this checklist **after completing all extraction phases** to ensure the agent meets quality standards before deployment.

> **Integration:** This checklist validates agents created via `tasks/create-copywriter-agent.md`

---

## How to Use

1. Complete all extraction phases (frameworks, communication DNA, phrases, arsenal, algorithms)
2. Assemble the agent file using `templates/copywriter-agent-tmpl.yaml`
3. Run through each section of this checklist
4. Calculate section scores and overall score
5. Address any failures before deployment
6. Create validation report at `outputs/minds/{slug}/analysis/validation-report.md`

---

## Scoring System

| Score | Status | Action |
|-------|--------|--------|
| 90-100% | ✅ Excellent | Deploy - agent is production-ready |
| 70-89% | 🟡 Good | Minor revisions - address flagged items |
| 50-69% | ⚠️ Needs Work | Major revision required - multiple sections incomplete |
| <50% | ❌ Failed | Re-extract - fundamental issues present |

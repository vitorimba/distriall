## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Identify Your Avatar
- Primary pain points (top 3)
- Desired outcomes (top 3)
- Common objections (top 3)

### Step 2: Write Headlines for Each Angle
Create 3 variations per angle = 21 headlines.

### Step 3: Select Top Performers
- Remove weak options
- Keep 7-10 strongest
- Ensure angle diversity

### Step 4: Develop into Full Ads
For each selected angle:
- Hook (headline)
- Body (2-3 sentences)
- CTA (clear action)

### Step 5: Create Visual Variations
Each angle gets 2-3 visual treatments:
- Image styles
- Video formats
- Carousel options

```yaml
angle_set:
  avatar: "[Target avatar]"

  problem_angles:
    - headline: ""
      body: ""
      cta: ""

  solution_angles:
    - headline: ""
      body: ""

## Testing Protocol

1. Launch all angles with equal budget
2. Run for minimum 3 days or 1000 impressions each
3. Kill losers (CTR < 1% or CPA > 2x target)
4. Scale winners (CTR > 2% and CPA < target)
5. Create variations of winners

## Subscription Architecture

### Monthly vs Annual

| Factor | Monthly | Annual |
|--------|---------|--------|
| Cash up front | Lower | Higher |
| Churn risk | Higher | Lower |
| Commitment | Lower | Higher |
| LTV potential | Depends | Locked in |

### Pricing Strategy

```
Annual = Monthly × 10 (get 2 months free)
Quarterly = Monthly × 2.75 (slight discount)
Monthly = Full price
```

### Value Ladder

```
Free → Entry Subscription → Core Subscription → Premium Subscription

Free: Lead magnet, builds list
Entry ($9-29/mo): Low barrier, high volume
Core ($47-197/mo): Main offer, best margin
Premium ($297+/mo): High touch, select clients
```

## Retention Architecture

### Week 1: Activation

### Month 1: Habit Formation

- Progress tracking
- Success celebration

### Month 3+: Results & Expansion
- Case study creation
- Referral ask
- Upsell to annual

---

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Define Core Value
What ongoing value justifies recurring payment?

```yaml
core_value:
  what_they_get_monthly: ""
  why_they_need_it_ongoing: ""
  cost_to_deliver: ""
```

### Step 2: Choose Continuity Type
Bonus, Discount, or Waived Fee?

### Step 3: Set Pricing Tiers
Monthly, quarterly, annual with appropriate discounts.

### Step 4: Design Retention System
What keeps them month after month?

### Step 5: Create Cancellation Flow
- Exit survey
- Win-back offer
- Pause option

Create a high-converting sales page using the 17-element blueprint.

> "A sales page is where money is made. Every element has a job — if it's not selling, it's killing." — Alex Hormozi

---

## The 17 Elements

### Block 1: Attention (Elements 1-3)
1. **Headline** — Dream outcome + timeframe + no common objection
2. **Subheadline** — Expand on the promise, add specificity
3. **Hero Visual** — Result or transformation image

### Block 2: Problem (Elements 4-6)
4. **Problem Agitation** — Name their pain specifically
5. **Failed Attempts** — What they've tried that didn't work
6. **Cost of Inaction** — What happens if they do nothing

### Block 3: Solution (Elements 7-9)
7. **Mechanism Introduction** — Your unique approach
8. **Origin Story** — Why you created this
9. **Credibility Stack** — Results, press, credentials

### Block 4: Offer (Elements 10-13)
10. **Component Stack** — Everything included with values
11. **Bonus Stack** — Extra value items
12. **Guarantee** — Risk reversal
13. **Price Anchor + Reveal** — 10x value, then real price

### Block 5: Close (Elements 14-17)
14. **Scarcity/Urgency** — Real deadline or limit
15. **CTA** — Clear action with button
16. **FAQ** — Handle remaining objections
17. **Final CTA + PS** — Last push

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Research Collection
```yaml
inputs_required:
  - Avatar profile (pains, desires, objections)
  - Offer details (components, bonuses, guarantee)
  - Proof assets (testimonials, results, credentials)
  - Competitor pages (what to beat)
```

### Step 2: Headline Creation
Use formula: `[Dream Outcome] in [Timeframe] without [Objection]`

Example:
> "Lose 20 Pounds in 6 Weeks Without Giving Up Your Favorite Foods"

### Step 3: Build Each Block
Write each of the 17 elements in order, ensuring:
- Each element connects to the next
- Proof supports every claim
- No dead ends (always lead to next section)

### Step 4: Validate Against Checklist

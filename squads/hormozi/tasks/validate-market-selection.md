## The "Starving Crowd" Principle

> "If you were going to open a hot dog stand, what is the one thing that would guarantee your success more than anything else? Not location. Not quality. Not price. A STARVING CROWD."

**Your job is NOT to create demand. It's to CHANNEL existing demand.**

## The 4 Market Indicators

Execute each indicator evaluation in sequence. **If ANY indicator scores < 7/10, STOP and reconsider market.**

### Indicator 1: MASSIVE PAIN (Dor Massiva)

> "The pain is the pitch. People must desperately need what you're selling."

**Scoring Rubric:**

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 10 | Life/business threatening, extreme urgency |
| 9 | Significant financial losses ($10k+/year) |
| 8 | Affects quality of life daily |
| 7 | Very bothersome, have tried to solve before |
| 6 | Recognized problem, but not urgent |
| 5 | Problem exists, but they live with it |
| 1-4 | Nice-to-have, not need-to-have |

**Diagnostic Questions:**
1. Have they LOST SLEEP over this problem?
2. Have they SPENT MONEY trying to solve it?
3. Do they ACTIVELY TALK about this problem?
4. Would they feel SHAME if others knew about it?

**Evidence Collection:**
```yaml
pain_evidence:
  lost_sleep: "yes/no + explanation"
  money_spent: "yes/no + how much"
  active_discussion: "yes/no + where"
  shame_factor: "yes/no + context"
  score: "/10"
  pass_threshold: "true/false"  # >= 7
```

### Indicator 2: PURCHASING POWER (Poder de Compra)

> "You can't sell to people who can't pay. No money = no deal, no matter how good your offer."

**Scoring Rubric:**

| Score | Description |

| 10 | Dedicated budget, easy approval, B2B with clear ROI |

**Diagnostic Questions:**
1. Do they ALREADY PAY for similar solutions?
2. Do they have DISPOSABLE INCOME after essentials?

### Indicator 3: EASY TO TARGET (Facil de Atingir)

## The Lloyd Case Study

**Why This Validation Exists:**

> "Lloyd was a fitness trainer. Excellent at what he did. But he chose to sell to 'personal trainers' — a market with high structural churn (many quit the profession). Even with identical skills, he failed in this market. When he pivoted to 'established gym owners' (same skillset), he thrived."

**Lesson:** The same person, with the same skills, FAILS in a bad market and THRIVES in a good market. The market is the dominant variable.

    proposed_adjustment: ""
    alternative_market: ""

  if_pass:

    main_acquisition_channels: []

## Market Comparison Matrix

If evaluating multiple markets, use this comparison:

| Indicator | Market A | Market B | Market C |
|-----------|----------|----------|----------|
| Massive Pain | /10 | /10 | /10 |
| Purchasing Power | /10 | /10 | /10 |
| Easy to Target | /10 | /10 | /10 |
| Growing | /10 | /10 | /10 |
| **TOTAL** | /40 | /40 | /40 |
| **Verdict** | | | |

**Rule:** Choose market with highest total, AS LONG AS all indicators >= 7.

---

## Quality Gate

```yaml
validation_quality:
  - [ ] All 4 indicators evaluated with EVIDENCE (not just opinion)
  - [ ] Scores based on rubric, not gut feeling
  - [ ] At least 2 sources cited per indicator
  - [ ] Comparison with alternative market done (if applicable)
  - [ ] Veto/Pass decision clearly stated
  - [ ] Next steps defined
```

---

## Handoff

After validation:
- **If PASS** → `create-grand-slam-offer.md`
- **If VETO** → Adjust avatar OR evaluate alternative market
- **After adjustment** → Re-run this validation task

---

## Anti-Pattern Warning: Niche Slapping

> "If you keep jumping from niche to niche thinking 'this one doesn't work', you deserve a 'niche slap'. Pick a market that passes the 4 indicators and COMMIT. Success comes from iteration WITHIN a niche, not from searching for a 'perfect' niche."

**Rule:** Do NOT abandon a validated market until you've executed the "Rule of 100" (see `execute-rule-of-100.md`)

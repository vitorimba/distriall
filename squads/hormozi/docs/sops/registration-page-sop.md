# Registration Page SOP

> **Source:** $100M Money Models Blueprint - Registration Page Content & Main Offer Landing Page
> **Pattern:** SC-PE-001 (SOP Extraction Standard)
> **Version:** 1.0.0
> **Extracted:** 2026-02-10

## Part 1: Purpose

Create registration pages for events, webinars, and launches that maximize opt-in conversions while building anticipation and pre-qualifying prospects for future offers. A registration page is NOT a sales page - it captures commitment and creates the foundation for the entire launch sequence.

**Core Philosophy:**
```
Registration Page = Commitment Device + Anticipation Builder + Lead Qualifier

Unlike landing pages that sell, registration pages:
├── Capture COMMITMENT (email, calendar block, mental investment)
├── Build ANTICIPATION (mystery, curiosity, FOMO)
├── Pre-QUALIFY (segment by engagement level)
└── Create ASCENSION PATH (free → VIP → premium)
```

**The Hormozi Registration Framework:**
"Pergunta rapida. Posso pegar seu endereco de email? Porque quero convida-lo para o maior evento de empreendedores da temporada." (Source: Pre_Event_Registration_VSL.md, line 5)

**Business Impact:** With proper registration page optimization, Hormozi achieved "mais de 1.000.000+ registrations by launch day" (Source: Registration_Page_Content.md, line 13). Registration is the gateway to the entire launch funnel - get this wrong, and everything downstream fails.

## Part 7: Exceptions & Edge Cases

### Exception 1: Cold Audience Registration
**Trigger:** Audience doesn't know you
**Adjustment:**
- More authority proof needed
- Consider video on registration page
- May need to explain the value more thoroughly
- Social proof numbers extra important

### Exception 2: Paid Event Registration
**Trigger:** Event has a cost to attend
**Adjustment:**
- Registration becomes checkout
- Value stack more prominent
- Guarantee considerations
- Use Landing Page SOP instead

### Exception 3: Time-Limited Registration
**Trigger:** Limited spots or closing deadline
**Adjustment:**
- Add countdown timer
- "X spots remaining" counter
- Real scarcity messaging
- More aggressive follow-up

### Exception 4: International Audience
**Trigger:** Global audience base
**Adjustment:**
- Full timezone list in all emails
- Consider time-friendly scheduling
- Multiple reminder emails at local times
- Replay option if possible

### Exception 5: Multi-Day Event
**Trigger:** Event spans multiple days
**Adjustment:**
- Session-by-session reminders
- Day-specific calendar adds
- Recap emails between days
- Engagement tracking per session

## Appendix C: VIP Benefits Stack Template

### Structure
```
VIP upgrade includes:

✅ Automatic entry to [PRIZE/GIVEAWAY] ([DETAILS])
✅ Your [PRODUCT] first & guaranteed first printing (shipped before everyone who waits)
✅ A private VIP livestream "Backstage Pass" (separate from the riff raff) with chat enabled to submit questions
✅ [BONUS WORKSHOP] - revealing [PROCESS] which will show you how you could [OUTCOME]. [VALUE STATEMENT]. (Recording included).

Reminder: People who wait to get their copy at the event will pay the same price but don't get any of the VIP Benefits.

My way of saying thank you for helping us out.

## Part 1: Purpose

Execute complete email and SMS campaign sequences for product launches, event registrations, and buyer nurturing. This SOP covers the **exact templates and sequences** used to generate millions of registrations and purchases.

**Core Objective:**
```
Move leads through a deliberate sequence:
Registration -> Pre-Order/VIP -> Event Attendance -> Post-Event Purchase -> Upsell

Each touchpoint maximizes:
- Open rates through compelling subject lines
- Click rates through clear CTAs
- Conversion through urgency and value stacking
```

**Business Impact:** A properly executed email/SMS campaign can convert 20-40% of registrants into buyers, with VIP pre-orders representing the highest LTV segment.

---

- Affiliate/referral program communications
- Cart abandonment recovery campaigns

### When This SOP Does NOT Apply

- Customer support communications
- Transactional emails (shipping, receipts)
- Cold outreach campaigns

## Part 4: The Campaign Architecture Framework

### Campaign Phase Overview

```
+------------------+-------------------+--------------------+-------------------+
|   REGISTRATION   |    PRE-LAUNCH     |      LAUNCH        |    POST-LAUNCH    |
+------------------+-------------------+--------------------+-------------------+
| Confirmation     | Countdown emails  | Event reminders    | Purchase confirm  |
| Affiliate invite | Value reveals     | 48h/24h/1h         | Bonus access      |
| VIP upsell       | Social proof      | Last chance        | Upsell sequences  |

     45-14 days           14-1 days           Launch Day          Post-Event
```

### Sequence Structure Principle
Every email sequence follows the **AIDA-U Pattern:**
- **A**ttention: Subject line that demands open
- **I**nterest: First line hooks with relevance
- **D**esire: Value stack and social proof
- **A**ction: Single, clear CTA
- **U**rgency: Deadline or scarcity element

who wants to invite their: slack group, team, friend group, online
community, email list, organic following, or just people they know.

It's simple: you give them a link to register for free. When they do,
you get credit for it.

But - so it's not weird - I made the prizes things that benefit you
AND them. That way it's more like "let's all chip in together" rather
than "do me a favor."

Hey, Alex here.

$100M Money Models - my new book - is coming out on Aug 16th, 2025.

[Register for the free live book launch extravaganza PLUS
preorder your copy here.]

I started writing this when preparing for my first big exit (2020).
I wanted to crystallize all my highest ROI "money models" in one place.

A money model is a series of offers deliberately structured to
generate the most cash up front, get the most leads, and get the
highest lifetime value.

Simply put - a well-designed money model gets more customers,
to spend more money, faster, again and again.

This is my crowning achievement. Of all the content I've made,
this book will teach you the most.

-> [Register + preorder here]

THE BIGGEST PS OF ALL TIME - btw...this launch took an extra year
because I've also got something huge to give everyone. I can't tell
you what it is, but it's better than an NFT but less than a Bitcoin
and every single person who shows up live gets one.
```

(If you're already registered, you're good).

Btw...I'm also giving away something huge to everyone who shows up-
and It's better than an NFT but less than a Bitcoin...but here's
the catch: You have to show up live to get it.

So I've done two things:

Subject: What's a money model?

What's a Money Model?

A Money Model is a series of offers deliberately structured to
generate the most cash up front, get the most leads, and get your
highest customer lifetime value. Period.

In simpler terms it attracts more customers, gets them to spend
more money, faster, over and over again.

A proper Money Model includes four parts:
- Attraction Offers: to get the most leads
- Upsell Offers: to get more money from them faster
- Downsell Offers: to turn a "no" into a "yes"
- Continuity Offers: to keep them buying again and again

It took me years to realize - every super successful business
I've owned had all four parts perfectly sequenced.

Most businesses putter along with only 1 or 2 parts - but -
the magic happens when you combine all the parts together.

$100M Money Models is coming out on August 16th, 2025.

Christmas has come early for entrepreneurs everywhere...

In just 28 days, I'm launching $100M Money Models - and my
"Secret" Project...

To do it, we are going bigger than ever.

[IMAGE: Truck filled with books]
[IMAGE: Warehouse pallets]

Why am I showing you this?

Because I need your help.

More specifically, my warehouse guys asked me to ask you for help.

Main reason: shipping 1 million books takes 1 million minutes
(at 1 min per book that's 694 days or two full years of work
for one man...working 24 hours a day).

So, if you help them out by pre-ordering a copy, I'll make it
worth your while. If you register and preorder, I'll upgrade
you to VIP FOR FREE.

-> [Register & preorder]

PS - If you want to guarantee that you get yours, and get it
before anyone else, pre-order it now.

I spent this last year working on this huge secret giveaway for
one purpose - to reward everyone who shows up live.

I can't tell you what it is, but I can tell you that it's
better than an NFT but less than a Bitcoin.

If you want to get one - you only have to do two things:
1. Register for the book launch here
2. Show up on August 16th at 9am PT / 12pm ET

That's it.

But to be clear - you'll have to show up to get it.

How will we know who showed?...we will export the list of
people who show up live and only send those people the
surprise gift.

Calling this now: this will be the entrepreneur event of the year.

Can't wait to see your reaction when I reveal your mystery gift live.

Also - I've had a ton of people ask about the book launch details:

Place: I'm hosting the event on Youtube Live.
Date: August 16th
Time: 9am PT / 12pm ET

For context - it would take 6+ Madison Square Gardens at full
capacity to hold everyone for this event ^

Power of $100M Money Models btw.

**Email Template (7):**
```
Subject: 5 Mystery headliners...1 event...free?

Imagine sitting down in the same room with...

A service business owner so massive their Money Model defined
an industry.

Or a professional services titan who scaled to a multi-9 figure
exit, then went back and did it again scaling another company
past a billion dollars...by having better money models.

Or a software entrepreneur who was able to beat VC backed
competitors by outspending them because he had a better
Money Model.

What would you ask them?
How much would it cost to get into a room like this?
What would you learn that could change your business?

Most people would charge you $199 to $599 just to see them speak.

-> I'm doing it FOR FREE

If you want to engage directly with them and submit questions
live - upgrade to VIP for free by just preordering a single book.

**Email Template (9):**
```
Subject: Did you miss this?

We're 7 days away. A lot of people miss this...

Every book in the $100M series has been a meta book.

This means the book demonstrates tactics that actually work.

With $100M Offers - is a book about making offers so good
people feel stupid saying no...I put it on Kindle for .99 cents
and made an Instagram post. But...it also came with a full
course, for free, no optin required. The offer for the book
itself showed you how to make offers.

$100M Leads - is all about advertising: ads, content, outreach,
affiliates, employees, agencies, referrals. And we used all of
them to get over a mid-sized city registered.

$100M Money Models is all about making the right offers, in
the right order, at the right time...so you can monetize more
customers, at higher prices, faster, over and over again.

The Money Model for the book itself will show you how to
create your own Money Models.

This is the most powerful book I've ever written.

Expect fireworks.

-Alex

Hi [First Name],

Turns out even the $100M team makes mistakes. We accidentally
set up the original Zoom link as a webinar instead of a meeting.

You are now registered for the correct format.

There's nothing you need to do other than:
1. Delete the original Zoom calendar event
2. Look for a new email from Zoom confirming registration
3. Accept the new invite

You're still confirmed for Saturday, August 16 at 9:00 AM PT.

Thank you for your understanding.

The $100M Money Models Support Team

### Step 2: Craft Headline (Include 2+ Components)

```markdown
## HEADLINE ENGINEERING SCRIPT

### The 7 Headline Components (Include at least 2)

| Component | Description | Implementation |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| RECENCIA | Most recent possible | Add time marker: "just", "today", "this week" |
| RELEVANCIA | Personally significant | Use avatar language: "[THEIR ROLE]", "[THEIR PROBLEM]" |
| CELEBRIDADE | Including prominent people | Name drop: "Elon Musk", "Jeff Bezos", "Warren Buffett" |
| PROXIMIDADE | Close to home | Use local references or relatable situations |
| CONFLITO | Opposing ideas/people | Create tension: "vs", "why X is wrong", "unpopular opinion" |
| INCOMUM | Strange, unique, rare | Use surprising numbers or unexpected angles |
| EM ANDAMENTO | Stories still in progress | Ongoing: "Day 47 of...", "Update:", "Here is what happened next" |

### Headline Formula Template

[RECENCIA] + [RELEVANCIA] + [VALUE PROMISE]

EXAMPLES:
- "Just this morning [RECENCIA], I discovered why most [AVATAR] [RELEVANCIA] fail at [OUTCOME] [VALUE PROMISE]"
- "Here is what happened [RECENCIA] when I told [CELEBRITY] [CELEBRIDADE] about [TOPIC] [VALUE PROMISE]"
- "[AVATAR] [RELEVANCIA], this [INCOMUM] method [CONFLITO] everything you know about [TOPIC]"

### Headline Strength Checker

Score your headline (2+ = STRONG):
- [ ] Contains time marker (Recencia)
- [ ] Speaks directly to avatar (Relevancia)
- [ ] Mentions known person/brand (Celebridade)
- [ ] References relatable location/situation (Proximidade)
- [ ] Creates tension or opposition (Conflito)
- [ ] Has surprising/unusual element (Incomum)
- [ ] Implies ongoing story (Em andamento)

TOTAL: ___/7 (Minimum 2 required)
```

### Step 3: Match Format to Platform

```markdown
## FORMAT MATCHING SCRIPT

### Platform Format Requirements

| Platform | Optimal Length | Format Style | Hook Placement |
|----------|----------------|--------------|----------------|
| YouTube Long | 10-20 min | Educational, deep-dive | First 30 seconds |
| YouTube Shorts | 30-60 sec | Punchy, single point | First 3 seconds |
| Instagram Reels | 15-60 sec | Visual, fast-paced | First 2 seconds |
| TikTok | 15-60 sec | Authentic, raw | First 1 second |
| Twitter/X | 280 char | Pithy, quotable | First line |
| LinkedIn | 1300 char | Professional story | First 2 lines |
| Podcast | 30-60 min | Conversational, detailed | First 60 seconds |

### Format Adaptation Process

1. Identify target platform
2. Study top 5 performing content in your niche on that platform
3. Note: visual style, length, structure, editing pace
4. Adapt your content to match these expectations
5. Test and iterate based on performance
```

### RETAIN: Complete Implementation Script

```markdown
## RETENTION STRUCTURE SCRIPTS

### Structure 1: LISTS

USE WHEN: Information can be presented in any order
FLEXIBILITY: High
CURIOSITY MECHANISM: "How many items? What are they?"

SCRIPT:
"I have [NUMBER] [THINGS] about [TOPIC].
Each one builds on the last.
Number [X] is the one most people miss."

EXAMPLES:
- "7 Ways I Invested $1000 in My 20s That Paid Off"
- "28 Ways to Stay Poor"
- "12 Lessons I Learned After Making My First Million"

LIST TEMPLATE:
```
HOOK: [Number] [Things] [Outcome]

1. [First item] — [1-2 sentence explanation]
2. [Second item] — [1-2 sentence explanation]
...
[X]. [Most surprising item] — [Longer explanation with story]
...
N. [Final item] — [Wrap-up that ties back to hook]

REWARD: "If you apply even ONE of these..."
```

### Structure 2: STEPS

USE WHEN: Order matters, process-based
FLEXIBILITY: Low (sequential)
CURIOSITY MECHANISM: "What is the next step? What is the outcome?"

SCRIPT:
"This is the exact [NUMBER]-step process I used to [OUTCOME].
Step [X] is where most people quit.
But if you follow all [NUMBER], you will [PROMISE]."

EXAMPLES:
- "3 Steps to Create a Great Hook"
- "How I Create a Headline in 7 Steps"
- "The Morning Routine That Increased My Productivity"

STEPS TEMPLATE:
```
HOOK: How to [OUTCOME] in [NUMBER] steps

Step 1: [Action] — [Why this must be first]
Step 2: [Action] — [How this builds on step 1]
...
Step X: [The step most skip] — [Why this is critical]
...
Step N: [Final action] — [What happens when complete]

REWARD: "Once you complete step [N], you will have [OUTCOME]"
```

### Structure 3: STORIES

USE WHEN: Teaching through example, emotional connection
FLEXIBILITY: Medium (narrative arc required)
CURIOSITY MECHANISM: "What happened next?"

SCRIPT:
"Let me tell you about the time [SITUATION].
Everything was going [CONTEXT].
Then [TURNING POINT] happened.
Here is what I learned."

EXAMPLES:
- "My editor made me do 19 drafts of this book"
- "My journey from sleeping under a gym to a 5-star hotel"
- "The day I realized I was working on the wrong things"

STORY TEMPLATE:
```
HOOK: [Intriguing situation or outcome]

CONTEXT: "So there I was..." [Set the scene]
RISING ACTION: "Everything was [GOING WELL/BADLY] until..."
TURNING POINT: "Then [THIS HAPPENED]..."
LESSON: "That is when I realized..."
APPLICATION: "So now, whenever I [SITUATION], I [ACTION]"

REWARD: "If you remember nothing else, remember this: [LESSON]"
```

### Advanced: INTERWEAVING Structures

SCRIPT:
"For complex content, weave structures together:
- Lists within steps (each step contains a mini-list)
- Stories to reinforce steps (example for each step)
- A list of stories (multiple case studies)
- Ongoing storylines (continued in next piece)"

INTERWEAVING TEMPLATE:
```
HOOK: [Promise of comprehensive value]

STORY OPENER: "When I first [SITUATION]..."

STEP 1: [Action]
  - Sub-item A
  - Sub-item B
  - MINI-STORY: "For example, [CLIENT] did this and..."

STEP 2: [Action]
  - Sub-item A
  - Sub-item B
  - MINI-STORY: "I remember when I..."

[Continue pattern]

STORY CLOSER: "Looking back, the journey from [START] to [END]..."

REWARD: [Comprehensive value delivered]
```
```

### REWARD: Complete Implementation Script

```markdown
## REWARD DELIVERY SCRIPTS

### Maximize Value Per Second

SCRIPT:
"Review your content. For every 10 seconds, ask:
- Does this ADD value or WASTE time?
- Would I be bored at this point?
- Can I cut this without losing meaning?"

VALUE DENSITY CHECKLIST:
- [ ] No filler phrases ("like I said", "basically", "you know")
- [ ] No unnecessary backstory
- [ ] No repetition without purpose
- [ ] No tangents that do not serve the main point
- [ ] Every sentence either teaches, entertains, or moves forward

### Fulfill Your Promise

SCRIPT:
"Compare your hook promise to your content delivery:
- Hook promised [X] things? Deliver [X] or more.
- Hook promised [SPECIFIC OUTCOME]? Show exactly how.
- Hook promised [TRANSFORMATION]? Demonstrate proof."

PROMISE FULFILLMENT CHECKLIST:
- [ ] If hook says "7 ways" — content has 7 distinct ways
- [ ] If hook says "step-by-step" — every step is actionable
- [ ] If hook says "secret" — reveal something not commonly known
- [ ] If hook targets [AVATAR] — content applies to [AVATAR]
- [ ] If hook promises [OUTCOME] — content enables [OUTCOME]

### Exceed Expectations

SCRIPT:
"After fulfilling the promise, add unexpected bonus value:
- One extra tip they did not expect
- A shortcut that saves time
- A resource they can use immediately
- A story that reinforces the lesson"

EXPECTATION EXCEEDING TEMPLATE:
```
[DELIVER PROMISED VALUE]

"Now, here is something I did not mention in the hook..."
[BONUS VALUE]

"And if you want to go even deeper..."
[RESOURCE OR NEXT STEP]
```

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## SECTION 4: GIVE AWAY THE SECRETS FRAMEWORK
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### The Philosophy

```markdown
## GIVE AWAY THE SECRETS FRAMEWORK

### Core Principle
"Give away your secrets. The people who can implement them were never
going to pay you anyway. The people who cannot implement them will pay
you to do it for them."

### The Give:Ask Ratio

BENCHMARKS:
- Television: 47min give, 13min ask (3.5:1)
- Facebook: ~4:1 content to ads
- Growing platforms: "give give give... give give give... maybe ask"

STRATEGY BY STAGE:
| Stage | Give:Ask | Rationale |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| Building (0-10K) | 20:1 | Pure value, build trust |
| Growing (10K-100K) | 10:1 | Introduce offers softly |
| Scaling (100K+) | 5:1 | Established trust allows more asks |
| Mature (1M+) | 3.5:1 | Can monetize at TV ratio |
```

### Implementation by Content Type

```markdown
## GIVE AWAY SECRETS: BY CONTENT TYPE

### YouTube Long-Form (Give Heavy)

INTEGRATED OFFER APPROACH:
- Give 58.5 minutes of pure value
- 3 x 30-second mentions = 1.5 minutes ask
- Place offers after valuable moments

EXAMPLE SCRIPT:
```
[After delivering major insight]
"By the way, if you want the complete system I use for this,
I have a free resource at [LINK]. It is a 47-page guide that walks
you through every step. No email required. Just download it."
[Return to content]
```

### Short-Form Video (Intermittent Approach)

RATIO: 10 give posts : 1 ask post

GIVE POST EXAMPLE:
```
Hook: "Here is why most businesses fail at X"
Meat: Full explanation with actionable insight
Reward: Value delivered, no ask
```

ASK POST EXAMPLE:
```
Hook: "I have something for you"
Context: "For the past 6 months, I have been giving you [VALUE]"
Offer: "Now I am looking for 5 [AVATARS] to help..."
CTA: "DM me [WORD] if you want details"
```

### Newsletter (High Give, Soft Ask)

STRUCTURE:
- 90% pure value content
- 10% single CTA at end
- Never interrupt value for promotion

EXAMPLE CTA:
```
---
That is it for this week.

If you want to go deeper on this topic, I put together
a free workshop that walks through the entire process.
Grab it here: [LINK]

Talk next week,
[Name]
```

### Podcast (Integrated, High Value)

RATIO: 3 x 30-second mentions per hour

MENTION SCRIPT:
```
"Before we continue, quick mention —
if you are loving this episode, you will probably love
our free resource on [TOPIC]. I put everything we are
discussing today into a downloadable guide at [URL].
Now, back to what we were saying about..."
```
```

### Lead Magnet Scripts

## SECTION 11: THE SEVEN LESSONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

| # | Lesson | Application |
|---|--------|-------------|
| 1 | "How I" not "How To" | Speak from experience, not prescription |
| 2 | Remind more than teach | Repeat yourself — 1 in 5 did not know |
| 3 | Puddles → Ponds → Lakes → Oceans | Start narrow, expand over time |
| 4 | Content creates sales tools | Create "greatest hits" for sales team |
| 5 | Free content retains customers | Customers include free content in ROI |
| 6 | Higher standards, not shorter attention | No such thing as too long, only too boring |
| 7 | Avoid pre-scheduling | Manual posting creates pressure to improve |

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## SECTION 15: ANTI-PATTERNS AND GUARDRAILS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

```yaml
anti_patterns:
  never_suggest:
    - Prioritizing monetization over audience growth
    - Pre-scheduling when manual is possible
    - Speaking prescriptively instead of experientially
    - Spreading thin before mastering one platform
    - Measuring quality without audience growth proof
    - Creating content without hook-retain-reward structure
    - Using filler or fluff in content
    - Making promises content does not fulfill
    - Over-asking relative to value given

  always_check:
    - Does content have clear hook with 2+ headline components?
    - Does content use retention structures (lists/steps/stories)?
    - Does content fulfill the hook promise?
    - Is give:ask ratio appropriate for growth stage?
    - Am I speaking from experience (How I) not prescription (How To)?
    - Is value per second maintained throughout?
    - Would I consume this content to the end?

  red_flags:
    - Audience not growing: "Content quality issue — improve or increase volume"
    - Engagement but no growth: "Not reaching new people — adjust platform strategy"
    - Growth but no monetization: "Check give:ask ratio — may be time to ask"
    - High drop-off rate: "Hook-content mismatch or low value density"
    - Low share rate: "Content not exceeding expectations"
```

### objection_algorithms

```yaml
objection_algorithms:
  - objection: "I do not have time to create that much content."
    response: |
      You do not need more time. You need a better system.

      One long-form piece becomes 10+ short-form pieces.
      A 60-minute podcast becomes: 5 clips, 3 carousels, 10 tweets, 1 blog post.
      That is a week of content from one recording session.

      When I put out 10x more content, my audience grew 10x faster.
      The bottleneck is not time — it is your production system.
      Depth-first: master one format, one platform, then repurpose.

  - objection: "My content gets no engagement. Nobody watches."
    response: |
      Low engagement means your hooks are failing. The Content Unit Framework
      says: Hook first, then Retain, then Reward.

      If they never click, you have a HOOK problem.
      If they click but leave, you have a RETAIN problem.
      If they watch but do not follow, you have a REWARD problem.

      Send me your last 5 pieces. I will diagnose exactly where the
      Content Unit Framework is breaking down. The fix is usually in
      the first 3 seconds — the hook.

  - objection: "I should be monetizing my content, not giving everything away."
    response: |
      The moment you start asking for money is the moment you decide to
      slow your growth. Give:Ask ratio should be at minimum 3.5:1.

      78% of all customers consumed at least TWO pieces of long-form content
      before buying. Your free content IS your sales team. It builds trust,
      demonstrates competence, and creates reciprocity.

      Give away your best stuff. The people who consume it and get results
      will pay you for implementation, speed, and access. The content is not
      the product — the audience is the asset.

  - objection: "I should be on every platform at once to maximize reach."
    response: |
      Breadth-first is a trap. Puddles to Oceans.

      Start on ONE platform. Master the Content Unit Framework there.
      Build a real audience — not 500 followers across 7 platforms.
      Once you dominate one platform, THEN expand.

      Depth-first scaling means your content quality and volume are world-class
      on one platform before you split attention. The evidence is clear:
      creators who master one platform first grow faster in aggregate.
```

### output_examples

```yaml
output_examples:
  - input: "I want to start creating content but I do not know what to post about."
    output: |
      Use the 5 Topic Categories. Every content idea comes from one of these:

      1. DISTANT PAST: Lessons from failures, origin stories, transformations
         → "How I went from $0 to $1M in 18 months"

      2. RECENT PAST: Wins and lessons from last 90 days
         → "I just lost my biggest client. Here is what I learned."

      3. PRESENT: What you are doing right now, real-time documentation
         → "Behind the scenes of launching our new offer this week"

      4. TRENDS: Industry observations, market shifts, predictions
         → "3 changes in [industry] that will matter in 2026"

      5. FABRICATED: Frameworks, lists, hypotheticals from your expertise
         → "The 5 mistakes every [niche] business makes"

      Start with DISTANT PAST — your personal stories have the most
      emotional pull and zero competition. Nobody else has your story.

      Pick ONE category. Write 5 headlines using at least 2 of the
      7 Headline Components (Recency, Relevance, Celebrity, Proximity,
      Conflict, Unusual, Ongoing). Send them to me. I will score them.

  - input: "My YouTube videos get views but nobody subscribes."
    output: |
      Views without subscribers means your REWARD step is broken.

      Content Unit Framework diagnosis:
      - HOOK: Working (they clicked)
      - RETAIN: Working (they watched)
      - REWARD: Failing (they did not follow through)

      FIX THE REWARD:
      1. Did you deliver on the hook promise? If the hook promises
         "5 ways to get clients" and you only give 3, trust is broken.
      2. Is there a clear CTA to subscribe? Not just "subscribe" —
         tell them WHY: "I post [frequency] about [topic] so you never miss [benefit]."
      3. Is there a reason to come back? Tease next content.

      Value per second, not seconds of value. Every second must earn
      the next second. If the middle sags, they leave before the CTA.

      Send me your best and worst performing video. I will diagnose
      the exact moment the Content Unit breaks down.

  - input: "What is the right posting frequency?"
    output: |
      The answer is always: more.

      When I put out 10x more content, my audience grew 10x faster.
      There is no penalty for posting more — only for posting boring content.

      BENCHMARKS BY PLATFORM:
      - YouTube Long-form: 2-3x per week minimum
      - YouTube Shorts/TikTok/Reels: 1-3x per day
      - Twitter/X: 3-5x per day
      - LinkedIn: 1-2x per day
      - Newsletter: 1-2x per week

      But here is the key: volume WITHOUT the Content Unit Framework
      is just noise. Every piece must Hook, Retain, Reward.

      Start with the maximum sustainable volume on ONE platform.
      Measure audience growth weekly. If growth is flat with volume,
      the problem is quality (Hook-Retain-Reward), not quantity.
```

## Process Execution Checklist

### Payment Plan Downsell (Process I)

#### Step 1: Prepay Discount
- [ ] Present price WITH interest included as anchor
- [ ] Offer prepay as "discount" not avoiding "fee"
- [ ] Use language: "It's $X, but $Y if you prepay. You save $Z."
- [ ] Wait for response before moving to step 2

#### Step 2: Third-Party Options
- [ ] Offer financing: "Another company pays me, you pay them"
- [ ] Offer credit card: "Do you prefer I decide terms or you decide?"
- [ ] Offer layaway: "Pay before receiving, take your time"
- [ ] If all declined → Step 3

#### Step 3: Half Now, Half Later
- [ ] Ask: "When do you get paid?"
- [ ] Offer: "Half today, half when you get paid?"
- [ ] If declined: "What's the most you can put down today?"
- [ ] Schedule remaining balance to payday
- [ ] If still declined → Step 4

#### Step 4: Desire Check (GATE)
- [ ] Ask: "On a scale of 1-10, how much do you want this?"
- [ ] **If 8-10:** Continue to Step 5
- [ ] **If <8:** Ask "Why not a 10?" then pivot to Feature Downsell
- [ ] Document score in CRM

#### Step 5: Three-Payment Split
- [ ] Offer: "1/3 now, 1/3 next payday, 1/3 following payday"
- [ ] Align with customer's actual pay schedule
- [ ] If declined → Step 6

#### Step 6: Spread Evenly
- [ ] Calculate payments across service duration
- [ ] Example: "16-week program = 16 weekly payments"
- [ ] If declined → Step 7

#### Step 7: Free Trial
- [ ] Transition to Trial Process (Process II)
- [ ] "The sale ends here, at least for now" if trial also declined

---

### Trial with Penalty (Process II)

#### Step 1: Offer Trial Last
- [ ] Only after clear rejection of main offer + payment plans
- [ ] Script: "How about we start you for free? Would that work?"
- [ ] Frame as help, not sales tactic

#### Step 2: Get Card (GATE)
- [ ] Request card immediately: "Let me get your ID and card"
- [ ] If resistance: "It's just how we've always done it"
- [ ] **If no card → End conversation politely**
- [ ] Verify card works with small authorization

#### Step 3: Sell Staying and Paying (GATE)
- [ ] Ask: "If this gets you results, will you stay long-term?"
- [ ] Use integrity script about long-term vs quick fix
- [ ] **Must get verbal commitment before continuing**
- [ ] Document commitment

#### Step 4: Explain Fees (After Card)
- [ ] Explain penalty structure for non-compliance
- [ ] Frame as "keeping you on track"
- [ ] Have customer initial fee clause separately
- [ ] Timing: ALWAYS after card captured, never before

#### Step 5: Schedule Check-Ins
- [ ] Explain each check-in and its purpose
- [ ] Make clear these are mandatory
- [ ] Document that charges apply if missed
- [ ] Schedule all check-ins in calendar immediately

---

### Feature Downsell (Process III)

#### Strategic Removal Order
- [ ] **Remove HIGHEST value features first** - Makes customer see value
- [ ] Show price difference after removal
- [ ] Ask: "How about now?"
- [ ] If they re-upsell to main offer → Close on main

#### Quantity Reduction
- [ ] Product: "Start with 1 month instead of 3?"
- [ ] Service: "Start with 2 sessions instead of 4?"
- [ ] Maintain core value proposition

#### Quality Reduction
- [ ] Time: Specific hours vs anytime
- [ ] Days: Limited days vs any day
- [ ] Speed: Next day vs same day
- [ ] Ratio: Group vs 1-on-1
- [ ] Method: Text vs video call
- [ ] Provider: Team vs owner
- [ ] Format: Recorded vs live
- [ ] DIY vs Done-For-You

#### Feature Removal
- [ ] Remove guarantee (often most effective)
- [ ] Remove specific services (calls, chat, etc.)
- [ ] Remove premium features

#### DIY Alternative
- [ ] Last resort for service rejection
- [ ] Offer tools/products instead of service
- [ ] Products should support same outcome

| 3 | "Personalize, don't pressure" | Did I find their preferences first? |
| 4 | "Same thing, new ways" | Am I offering differently, not discounting? |
| 5 | "Never just lower price" | Did I remove value with the price reduction? |
| 6 | "Customers talk" | Am I using consistent pricing? |

## Anti-Pattern Check

**Result:** Customer said no to ALL offers AND lost trust in the car price.

**Self-Check:**
- [ ] I did NOT offer the same thing for less
- [ ] I offered DIFFERENT things at different prices
- [ ] Customer trust maintained
- [ ] Customer understands value-price relationship
